Durban - Suspects fleeing from police in a high-speed chase after an alleged house robbery in the Malvern area crashed head-on into a truck on the M7 in the vicinity of Southway Mall on Tuesday, killing at least one person. Marshall Security’s Andreas Mathios said one suspect died and multiple other suspects sustained injuries. “The incident started when the SAPS were chasing suspects for a house robbery that was committed in the Malvern area. The suspects then decided to drive contraflow, colliding with an oncoming truck head-on,” he said. He said a full investigation into the incident will be conducted by police. According to ALS Paramedics Medical Services director Garrith Jamieson, their paramedics responded to the collision and active crime scene on the M7 towards the Bluff on the Umbilo arterial on-ramp at about 1.30 pm. Jamieson said it is believed that the suspects’ vehicle was travelling at high speed contraflow and collided head-on with a truck.   “The driver of the light motor vehicle was severely entrapped in the wreckage and unfortunately passed away before paramedics arrived,” said Jamieson. He said five other occupants from the light motor vehicle sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on scene by ALS and Emergency and Medical Rescue Services (EMRS) paramedics under the watchful eye of the SAPS. “The truck driver had sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised on scene before being transported to a nearby hospital,” said Jamieson.   Mathios said the injured suspects have all been arrested. “We are asking members of the public to please avoid the area and comply with the instructions of the SAPS members on scene,” Mathios said. Jamieson said the M7 was severely congested with traffic. “SAPS cordoned off the scene for further investigation,” he said. Police have been approached for comment. THE MERCURY
