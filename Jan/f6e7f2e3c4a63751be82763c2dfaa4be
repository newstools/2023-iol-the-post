Durban — A suspected female drug dealer was expected in court on Friday after she was arrested with heroin, crack cocaine, dagga and money suspected to be proceeds of a crime. KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said that on Thursday, January 5, 2023, the Hawks members from Durban Serious Organised Crime Investigation working together with Crime Intelligence and Durban Metro K9 Unit arrested a 43-year-old suspect for dealing in drugs in Ottawa, Verulam. Mhlongo said that members had received information about the suspect who was dealing drugs in the area and an undercover operation was conducted. “The suspect was found in possession of heroin capsules, pieces of crack cocaine and dagga to the street value of approximately R 24 520. Members also seized R38 600 cash suspected to be proceeds of crime,” Mhlongo said. He said the woman was arrested and charged with drug dealing. She had been expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Friday, January 6, 2023. Meanwhile, last month, a drug dealer was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for drug dealing but five years of his sentence was wholly suspended. Mhlongo said the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court sentenced Zamokuhle Buthelezi, 33, to 13 years imprisonment for dealing in drugs and five years of his sentence was wholly suspended. Buthelezi was arrested by the Pietermaritzburg-based Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation in May 2018. Members received information about the suspect who was dealing drugs, they proceeded to a house and a search was conducted. The members found straws of heroin, mandrax tablets, and dagga with a street value of approximately R250 660. “He was placed under arrest and he appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court. His bail application was successfully opposed and he was remanded in custody until he was convicted and sentenced,” Mhlongo said. Daily News
