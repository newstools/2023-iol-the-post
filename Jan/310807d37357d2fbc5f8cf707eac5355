Durban — When the weather is hot, babies and young children should be kept in a cool, shady place, given enough clean, cool water to drink, and get plenty of rest.  This is according to the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC).  In a statement they said babies and children have thin skins, and may easily suffer from sunburn.  They should wear wide-brimmed hats that allow the air to move through them. “If you think your baby or child is suffering from heat illness, get medical help as soon as possible. Tiny red spots, like blisters or pimples. This can be a heat rash. It is not a medical emergency,” said the SAMRC. Here are the signs of heat illness: • unconscious • irritable, restless and confused • floppy body and no energy • can’t breathe easily • dizzy • sore head • the soft spot on top of a baby’s head (fontanelle) may be lower (sunken) than usual • sunken ‘soft spots’, eyes or cheeks • vomiting • dry mouth or tongue • thirsty at first, but as baby gets weaker they may drink less • dry eyes and baby or child doesn’t have many tears when crying • temperature going up but no sweating • drier skin but, as heat illness gets worse, skin becomes cool and moist • skin is cool when you touch it, but then becomes hot and red • fewer wet nappies than usual • dark yellow or smelly urine • muscle cramps in legs or stomach. What to do If you see a baby (or anyone) is showing signs of a heat illness, get medical advice.  The baby or child may need to be treated at a hospital or clinic. In the meantime you can settle your child in a cool place, wet their clothes with cool water, or wet a cloth and wipe it on their skin.  Talk with your baby or child in a calm way, if your baby or child can still respond to you, try to give them something to drink.  Give the baby plenty of breast milk or formula and, if 6 months or older, a little water, don’t give your baby or child medicine – let the healthcare workers decide what is best. Daily News
