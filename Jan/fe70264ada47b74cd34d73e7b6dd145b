Durban - While a fibre technician worked on a fibre box in the Avoca area of Durban on Tuesday, a man carrying a knife stole the new vehicle. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said at about 3.50pm the Marshall Security Emergency Dispatch Centre received panic activations from a client’s premises on Bailey Road in the Avoca area. Powell said multiple armed response officers and members of the security company’s special ops team were activated and arrived on scene within minutes to investigate. “It was established that a network service technician had left his vehicle idling while attending to a nearby fibre box. While he was conducting his work, he noticed a suspect armed with a knife that had got into his vehicle and drove off,” he said. “It was determined that the stolen vehicle was fitted with Tracker SA, who then activated members of our Special Ops Team to assist with locating it. “Our team members immediately responded and within four minutes of being activated, the vehicle was found abandoned on Msinsi Lane in the Quarry Heights area where it was recovered by Tracker SA assisted by members of our Special Ops Team, the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit, and the SAPS Greenwood Park Trio Crimes Unit.”  Powell said most of the items that were inside the vehicle had been removed and could unfortunately not be recovered. He said the vehicle was handed back to the owner as he did not desire to open a case. Powell said vehicle-related crimes are still a regular occurrence and urged Durban motorists to be extremely vigilant. “Never leave your car idling when you are getting out of it for a short period, always check the door handles when locking your vehicle to prevent remote jamming, and we highly recommend that you get a tracking unit installed for an increased chance of recovery,” he advised.
