WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES BELOW Durban — The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has condemned the mass slaughter of Pongola Lake elephants and has called for national intervention. DA KZN Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (Edtea) spokesperson Heinz de Boer said the Pongola Lake was becoming an elephant poaching “slaughterhouse”. “Armed groups of poachers have now completely laid siege to the eastern shores of the lake, with several elephant carcasses recently found while dozens of gunshots have also been reported in the region,” De Boer said. “Guards near the eSwatini border have allegedly also come under attack and infrastructure damaged and torched by the armed gang.” De Boer said that the DA also received video and photographic evidence of a tour boat coming under fire by armed gangs who continue to lay illegal gill nets in the lake. In the video that the “Daily News” has seen, people on a tour boat were repeatedly told to lie flat down and to stay down. When it seemed that the crisis had been averted, the people were asked if they were okay. However, they remained down. One person could be heard saying that the gunmen were shooting the elephants. “The rampant lawlessness and decimation of flora and fauna within this community has long been highlighted, with the conflict brewing for years. Yet, to date, the government has failed to secure this tourist and wildlife haven,” De Boer said. “In the interim, the lake has been systematically stripped of its fish stock with only the Richards Bay SAPS Water Wing and concerned locals to try to stop the scourge.” De Boer added that the party would escalate the ongoing war against poaching to the highest levels of government and demand the swift arrest of those who believe they can destroy our natural heritage and tourism sector. The situation can no longer continue. KZN Edtea has been approached for comment.  Daily News
