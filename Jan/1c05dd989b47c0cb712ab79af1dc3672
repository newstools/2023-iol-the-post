Durban – The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport will on Monday launch the construction of a R300 million road upgrade project in Dududu, on the province’s South Coast. The contract is for upgrading the main P77 road which links Scottburgh and towns in the Harry Gwala districts. The road will be upgraded from gravel to tar. The launch event will take place at the Phindavele sports ground in Dududu. According to the department, the first 17km of the main road had already been surfaced and Transport MEC Sipho Hlomuka will launch the second 10km phase.  The transport department said the road will connect residents of uMdoni Local Municipality with important amenities such as schools, clinics, public transport, and other business opportunities and the 10km phase will connect the Zembeni and Bele traditional councils. Hlomuka said infrastructure development was important for job creation and economic growth. “P77 is a strategic route. As the government, we are rolling out massive infrastructure programmes to build, rehabilitate and maintain roads and bridges. After the floods there is a need to act with speed and urgency to improve our infrastructure,” he said. THE MERCURY
