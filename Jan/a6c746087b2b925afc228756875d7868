Durban - The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) in KwaZulu-Natal has said that the fund is resuming its campaign to process and pay unemployment benefits to former teaching and general assistants in the province. In a statement, the UIF said the campaign started in the Amajuba District Municipality in November 2022, where the fund disbursed R7.7 million to 1746 former educator assistants and general assistants.  These former assistants were employed under the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, which was implemented as part of the Basic Education Employment Initiative across all nine provinces to reduce youth unemployment in the country. The fund said that last month officials were in eThekwini Municipality, where R28.8m was paid out to 6204 beneficiaries.  It said to date, an amount of R36.5m has been paid out to 7950 clients. The UIF said this week and next week, it will be processing and paying out claims in the Zululand District Municipality as follows: The fund said beneficiaries are urged to bring along their identity or valid passport documents, a smartphone with data, and proof of account (banking details). “When their contracts ended, the former employees qualified to claim unemployment insurance benefits from the UIF. Due to the large volume of claims anticipated and to prevent long queues at Labour Centres, the UIF team in KwaZulu-Natal met with the provincial Department of Education and agreed on a consolidated approach. This included the department availing venues while the fund confirms the compliance of the former workers in terms of their employment history, declarations, and contributions. “The UIF in KwaZulu-Natal will be rolling out the project to other parts of the province and will announce dates and details in due course.” THE MERCURY
