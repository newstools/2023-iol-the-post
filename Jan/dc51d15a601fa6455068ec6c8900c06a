Durban — A 22-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon after robbing a Pep store on Pixley KaSeme Street (West Street) on Tuesday.  The suspect boarded a bus to evade arrest. The suspect was found in possession of stolen money, firearms and two cellphones which belong to two Pep employees.  KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said the suspect was with two others when they allegedly committed the crime. He said a concerted effort by the SAPS and Durban Metro police resulted in the suspect’s arrest.  “The three suspects are reported to have stormed into a store on West Street and robbed money and employees’ cellphones at gunpoint. Reports also indicate that the suspects boarded a bus to escape from the scene of the crime,” Netshiunda said. He said a swift response by law enforcement agencies led to the interception of the bus on Anton Lembede Street (Smith Street) and one suspect was nabbed. “Further investigations revealed that the same suspect was previously arrested in May 2021 for the same offence. The other two suspects evaded arrest and a manhunt for them is under way,” said Netshiunda. In a statement, the Metro Police said the men boarded a People Mover bus. Police found the suspect in possession of two firearms,  R11 370 cash and two Samsung cellphones belonging to staff members at the store.  Metro police said that the arrested suspect was detained at the Durban Central police station. Daily News
