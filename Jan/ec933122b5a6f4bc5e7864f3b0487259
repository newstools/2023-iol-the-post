Durban - In a country with a high unemployment rate, finding training and employment opportunities is a daunting task for matriculants entering the job market.  To equip job seekers with various skills and improve their chances of finding work, the Department of Employment and Labour provides employment services at its 126 labour centres and 475 visiting points in urban and rural areas across the country.  Opportunities range from general learnerships to office administration, retail, community and other work options.  Acting spokesperson Mokgadi Pele said the department, through its Public Employment Services branch, assists job seekers to enter the labour market. The department has more than 186 psychology staff who help work seekers with advice on securing employment and training opportunities.  They also hire more than 200 employment practitioners to canvas job opportunities with employers who are registered on the department’s Employment Services of South Africa (Essa) system.  “It is worth emphasising that all the department’s services are offered free of charge to the public and employers, and can also assist employers to secure specialised staff by offering psychometric testing services, administered by registered psychologists,” said Pele.  To assist employers to find skilled staff with the appropriate competencies, potential and aptitude for work, the department also offered this service free of charge to employers. To access these opportunities, work seekers should register on the Essa system. “Annually, about 60 000 work opportunities can be applied for.  This is continuously updated by the employment practitioners in the department.”  For those who have access to the internet, registration can be done online at https://essa.labour.gov.za/ EssaOnline/WebBeans/ Those without internet access can visit their closest labour centre for assistance.
