Durban - A man was attacked by two of his neighbour’s pit bulls while heading home from a friend’s house in the early hours of Sunday morning in Trenance Park in the Amaotana area near Verulam. Security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said residents who witnessed the attack on the 44-year-old man called Rusa after midnight. Balram said reaction officers were immediately dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival the officers found the man lying on the side of the road, he said. “According to (the man), he was returning home after visiting a friend when his neighbour’s two pit bulls jumped over the driveway gate and attacked him,” said Balram. Balram said the man’s friend attempted to assist but he was also bitten on his arm and leg. “According to witnesses, the dogs mauled (the man) for more than 20 minutes before their owner arrived and removed them back to his property.  Balram said the man and his friend were rushed to Osindisweni Government Hospital (OGH) for urgent medical attention and remain in critical condition. The pictures were too graphic and could not be shown. The police have been approached for comment. The attack comes after similar attacks in other parts of the country. A 43-year-old woman died after two of the dogs attacked her in Limpopo in late December. THE MERCURY
