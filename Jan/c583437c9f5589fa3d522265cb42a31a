Durban — A 13-year-old boy was killed when a minibus taxi crashed into a cow in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday afternoon. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said that the boy was killed after the taxi struck the animal on the P100 in Ndwedwe. Balram said passing motorists contacted Rusa at 6.01pm requesting assistance at the scene. On arrival, Rusa personnel found paramedics from the provincial ambulance service in attendance. “It was established that the white Toyota Quantum struck a cow before the driver veered across the oncoming lane. The minibus collided into a metal barrier which ripped the sliding door off the vehicle and resulted in the teenager being ejected,”  Balram said. “The vehicle plummeted down an embankment before it came to a stop. The driver fled the scene. He was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. Six other children sustained minor to moderate injuries. They were transported privately to a medical facility. “The 13-year-old sustained life-threatening injuries and was pronounced deceased at the scene. It is alleged that the children were related to the driver who was transporting them to a family member’s residence at the time of the accident.” Balram said the cow sustained minor injuries and left the scene before the arrival of first responders. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said that a case of culpable homicide is being investigated by Ndwedwe SAPS after a 13-year-old boy died in an accident in the Mzunga area. Ngcobo said that four people sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital for medical attention. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated. In a similar incident in October last year, the driver of a minibus taxi was thrown off from the vehicle after he lost control of it while swerving to avoid a cow on Inanda Road. Daily News
