Durban – In order to ensure accurate billing,  the Msunduzi Municipality has announced the introduction of hand-held meter-reading devices with effect from January 1, 2023. In a statement on Wednesday, municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize said the hand-held device would allow the meter reader to capture the actual reading and upload the picture of the meter while on site. Mkhize said the reading app will then update the system. She said the system would only allow for the reading to be captured if the picture of the meter was also uploaded. “Therefore, the customers are urged to ensure that they provide access to the meter readers for the pictures to be taken,” Mkhize said. As an alternative, Mkhize said customers may consider communicating with the water and electricity sections to apply for meters to be moved to the boundary of the property where they are accessible at all times. She said due to the roll-out of the hand-held devices certain residential and business consumer accounts may be estimated for the months of January/February 2023. “We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused and ensure you that the matter will be resolved as soon as possible,” Mkhize said. The municipality encouraged consumers to submit their monthly meter readings to meter.readings@msunduzi.gov.za and attach the pictures of the meter with the current reading. An emailed reading would not be considered if the picture showing the current reading and serial number of the meter was not attached, it said. “The municipality is committed to provide customers with accurate bills,” it said.
