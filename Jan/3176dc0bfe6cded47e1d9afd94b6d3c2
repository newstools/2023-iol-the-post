Durban — ActionSA says it will be launching a public engagement campaign to seek the views of all South Africans about the solutions needed to fix the country. This campaign, which is expected to take place in the weeks leading up to the State of the Nation Address (SONA), will be taking the form of a series of events to highlight the impact of the African National Congress (ANC). According to ActionSA, South Africans have become all too familiar with the many challenges such as crumbling infrastructure, Stage 6 load shedding, 12 million people without jobs, and an education system that does not empower young people with the skills they need to succeed. President Herman Mashaba said their objective was to give the people a voice in finding solutions to these challenges. "After nearly three years it is clear that the ANC does not have the plans or solutions to address these challenges," said Mashaba. "ActionSA believes that these challenges can be overcome with the help of the good, hard-working, and law-abiding people of South Africa who love their country. If we work together, we can fix South Africa. We have to fix the challenges of poor education, crime and corruption, crumbling infrastructure including Eskom, our failing economy and unemployment,“ he said.  ActionSA were launching an online platform to empower South Africans to share their views. in addition to the face-to-face engagements that were set to commence on Monday.  "It is my firm belief that there is nothing bad about South Africa that cannot be fixed by what is good about South Africa, the people of our nation who want to see it succeed," Mashaba said. Mashaba further encouraged people to join the conversation and help shape a collective future defined by hope and prosperity. Daily News
