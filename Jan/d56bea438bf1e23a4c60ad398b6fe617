Durban - Durban Private school Reddam House in Ballito has produced its first class of 2022 matriculants – and all of them have excelled.  The group of 16 were the first group of pupils enrolled in 2019 to begin Grade 9 when the school opened its doors that year.  The school was founded by Graeme Crawford, who first founded the Crawford College group of schools in the country in 1993. It currently boasts nine schools, including Ballito and uMhlanga, in the province, and three Early Learning schools.  Reddam House Ballito held a ‘champagne breakfast’ for its matriculants on Wednesday to celebrate their achievements. Gia Naicker, 18, the top achiever at the school, scored eight distinctions and has been accepted at Stellenbosch University, where she will be studying towards a Mechatronic Engineering degree.  Karina Krishnaswamy, also 18, achieved five distinctions and will be studying Computer Science with Genetics, also at Stellenbosch University. The two friends, Naicker and Krishnaswamy, were excited because they will be sharing a dorm room at university.  They were also the only two at the school who did the subject Advanced Programme Mathematics (AP Maths). AP Maths is an optional subject in Grades 10 to 12 as an eighth subject for the National Senior Certificate. Khwezi Mkhize received one distinction and he is hoping to be accepted at the University of Cape Town to study Psychology.  Catherine Raw, head of Senior Prep and College at Reddam House Ballito, said the Grade 9s were the oldest group in the school when it opened, and took on a leadership role for the four years from Grade 9 to Grade 12. “This group of 16 students have exceeded their expectations with excellent results, and we are so proud of our 2022 matric students,” Raw said.
