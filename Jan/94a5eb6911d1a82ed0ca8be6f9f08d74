In a statement on Monday, KwaDukuza mayor Lindile Nhaca mourned Versters' untimely passing. “We dip our banner in honour of Mr Verster who worked tirelessly towards deepening democracy and accountability on behalf of the KwaDukuza Residents Forum. “Verster was a resilient community activist who will be remembered for his robustness, frankness and enduring commitment towards improving conditions of the people coupled with a hard-nosed approach to issues of service delivery,” said Nhaca. Nhaca said he was a true champion for social reform. “On behalf of the KwaDukuza council, we send our condolences to his family and the KDRF community. May the KDRF pick up the spear and continue the fight in honour of his work and ideals as a community activist,” said the mayor. Commenting on Speak Your Mind Ballito’s Facebook page, Debbie Spinner, said Verster was a giant on the Dolphin Coast (KwaZulu-Natal North Coast). “He was never shy to rattle nerves to get municipal attention on service delivery and other compounding issues on the Dolphin Coast. His passing will leave an enormous void in the community. We salute you Riaan for your relentless energy, principles and morals. Our heartfelt love and sympathy is extended to his wife, children, immediate and extended family. Speak Your Mind Ballito will never be the same again without your fiery spirit,” she said. THE MERCURY
