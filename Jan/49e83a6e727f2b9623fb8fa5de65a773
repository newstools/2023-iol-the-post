Durban: eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has given an update on the state of the city’s beaches and swimming pools, saying more have been opened. He was speaking during a media briefing on Thursday where he gave a report on how the city had performed during the festive season. Some of the beaches had to be closed in the run-up to the festive season due to sewage pollution. Water quality testing had shown high levels of E coli in the water. “During the festive season only 12 beaches were open for swimming. As a result of the progress we have made in repairing our (sewage) pump stations along the coastline, we have now been able to open more beaches. He said opened beaches include Point, uShaka, Addington, South Beach, Wedge, North Beach, Bay of Plenty, Toti Main, Brighton, uMdloti Main, uMgababa, uMhlanga Main, Westbrook and Battery Beach are opened.  He said the beaches that remain closed for swimming are Bronze, Country Club, Thekwini, Laguna, Reunion, Warner, Winkelspruit, Pipeline, Anstey’s and Causarina.  “The city continues to update the status of our beaches and pools as and when it changes. When we provided an update on the festive season in December, we indicated that only 25 swimming pools were open to the public. “Today, because of our aggressive maintenance plan, we are happy to report that as from last week we have seen the number of swimming pools that are open climb to 31,” he said.
