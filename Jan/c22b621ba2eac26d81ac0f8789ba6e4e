Durban — One security guard was killed, and another was left critical after a shooting and hijacking incident near the King Shaka International Airport on Tuesday evening. Medi Response spokesperson Paul Herbst said that late on Tuesday evening, Medi Response responded to a location near the airport following reports of a shooting. Herbst said that upon the arrival of crews, it was established that two security guards had been conducting perimeter patrols in their vehicle when they were attacked by unknown assailants and their vehicle hijacked. “Both guards were shot multiple times. One of the guards managed to flag down a passing taxi, which took the man to the airport police station,” Herbst explained. “Unfortunately, one of the two officers succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead on the scene. “The second officer was in a critical condition and was stabilised by Medi Response and Lenmed advanced life support paramedics,” Herbst said. He also conveyed their condolences to the affected guard’s family. Police have been approached for comment. Meanwhile, a 40-year-old man was shot dead in Umbilo on Monday afternoon. Emer-G-Med spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said that at approximately 5pm, Emer-G-Med paramedics, together with Netcare 911, responded to the scene of a shooting incident in Fennis Close in the Umbilo area. “On arrival on the scene, a male approximately forty years of age was found seated in a luxury motor vehicle with fatal gunshot wounds,” Van Reenen said. “He was declared dead on arrival of paramedics.” Van Reenen said that the motive for the shooting and the events preceding it were unclear and would form the subject of a police investigation.
