Durban - The four men accused of killing former eThekwini ward councillor Sunil Brijmohan will remain behind bars.  The National Prosecuting Authority said the four men appeared in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court this week.  NPA provincial spokesperson Natasha Kara said the matter was postponed until February 1, for a bail application.  “Accused 3 and 4 have opted to apply for bail. We will not be naming any of the accused at this stage.” Brigmohan, 46, a father of two, was killed in Cato Crest in Amanzimtoti on October 21.
