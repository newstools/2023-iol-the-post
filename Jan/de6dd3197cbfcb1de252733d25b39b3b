Durban – Three suspects who attempted to break into a business on Commercial Road in the Pietermaritzburg CBD were arrested on Thursday. According to security company, Mi7 National Group spokesperson Colin David, during the early hours of the morning an Mi7 business client on Commercial Road reported that CCTV cameras on the property were being tampered with by suspects attempting to gain entry. He said Mi7 reaction officers were immediately dispatched and conducted a full check of the premises. David said a description of the vehicle, a white bakkie, in which the suspects arrived, was also obtained. “After searching the area, Mi7 reaction officers spotted a vehicle matching the description at a nearby fuel station,” he said. He said other teams were also dispatched to strategically block off the area to prevent the vehicle from fleeing. David said the Mi7 control room operators also worked quickly to investigate the vehicle’s registration. It was established that the vehicle was reported stolen and was being sought by the police, he said. “Mi7 reaction officers moved in, bringing the vehicle to a halt on Church Street. Inside, three occupants were found with a number of common housebreaking implements,” said David. David said all three suspects were apprehended and the matter was handed over to the police for further investigation. THE MERCURY
