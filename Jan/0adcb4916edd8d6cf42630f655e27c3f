The player will also be offered trauma counselling by a team of psychologists,” she said. Mabuza said partnerships with seven banks, namely FNB, Standard Bank, Nedbank, Absa, Capitec, TymeBank, and African Bank, has ensured players are provided with the convenience of playing the National Lottery games digitally from the comfort of their homes.  “Last year alone, Ithuba had 19 millionaires that have played from our different banking partners,” said Mabuza.
