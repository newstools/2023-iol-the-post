Durban – The Education MEC in KwaZulu-Natal Mbali Frazer says the schools that were ravaged by floods last year are ready to open as they have been provided with mobile classrooms. Speaking during a visit to schools in the province on Wednesday along the KZN Premier Nomsa Dube-Ncube and Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, Frazer said the work to renovate the schools damaged by the floods in the province is ongoing.  Brettonwood High School in Umbilo was one of the hardest hit. “In Brettonwood, we have given them mobile classrooms and again for renovations, we are at the tender stage, so work is happening and if you can go back and check the data, several schools that were affected something has happened and we are still going to make sure that we fix classrooms,” said Frazer. Dube-Ncube, who welcomed the smooth start to the 2023 academic year, said children who lost documents during floods were assisted and “there is not a single family that was affected by the floods without documentation”. The provincial government said over 2.8 million learners across the province went back to school on Wednesday.  A total of 209 665 pupils have been admitted in Grade 1 and 237 987 pupils were admitted in Grade 8, the provincial government said in a statement.  THE MERCURY
