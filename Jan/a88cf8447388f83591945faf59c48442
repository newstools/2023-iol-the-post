Durban — Three men were arrested with unlicensed guns, ammunition and drugs. Police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said that the trio were nabbed during a pin-point operation by the Economic Infrastructure and Tracking Task Team that produced desired results when three suspects were arrested after they were found to be in an illegal possession of firearms, ammunition and drugs on Tuesday. Netshiunda said the team was acting on intelligence when they cornered the suspects in Montclair in Durban. "A 32-year-old suspect was found in possession of 34 rounds of ammunition and a substance suspected to be rock cocaine. "The second suspect, a 34-year-old, was found to be in illegal possession of a firearm whose serial number was filed off, as well as ammunition, while a 28-year-old suspect was also nabbed for being in illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition," Netshiunda said. "Subsequent investigations led to the recovery of rock cocaine which was left abandoned at nearby premises. The estimated street value of the recovered cocaine is approximately R200 000," he said. Meanwhile, Durban Metro Police Service spokesperson Senior Superintendent Boysie Zungu added that the tactical support unit arrested a suspect in Primula Drive in the Mobeni Heights area.
