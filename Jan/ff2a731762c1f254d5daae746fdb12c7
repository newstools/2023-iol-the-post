The registration of first-time and returning students has started in earnest at all KwaZulu-Natal universities, with the institutions saying the applications for enrolment exceeds the available spaces. However, prospective students often apply for more than one programme. The Durban University of Technology (DUT) and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) said they had already started with the registration of first-time students, while the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) and the University of Zululand (Unizulu) would begin with registration next week. Alan Khan, senior director of corporate affairs at DUT, said the university has 8  564 study spaces for first-year students this year. “DUT has received 174 925 applications for first-year study in 2023. The registration for both first-time entering new (FTEN) students and for returning students, commenced on Monday “Registration is scheduled to end on Friday.” Khan said the programme that had received the highest number of applications for the first-year entry was the diploma in hospitality management. “A total of 11 834 applications were received, with only 100 spaces available.” Dr Azwi Mufamadi from MUT said they had allocated 3 255 spaces for first-time entering students for this year. “MUT received a total of 85  789 applications which includes both undergraduate and postgraduate applications. However, MUT received 63  242 applications, specifically for places in the first-year class of 2023.” Mufamadi said there were three programmes at MUT that received tens of thousands of applications. “The diploma in information technology had the most applications with 15  099 received. The diploma in office technology had 13 640 applications and the diploma in public management had 11 635 applications.” Gcina Nhleko-Mdluli, communications and marketing director at Unizulu, said the university’s first-time entrants intake was close to 4  000. “The institution received over 140  000 applications for programmes offered in both the KwaDlangezwa and Richards Bay campuses.” Nhleko-Mdluli added that university registration would begin next week. “Registration for first-time entering students was scheduled to begin on Monday and end on February 3.  The scheduled registration dates for returning students are February 6 to 10,” Nhleko-Mdluli said. Normah Zondo, executive director of the corporate relations division at UKZN, said the university had approximately 8500 FTEN places available for the 2023 academic year. “The university received more than 250  000 applications from approximately 110  000 prospective students for these places. “This high number of applications is because most students apply for admission to more than one programme. Due to the high number of applications received, the university is thus unable to accommodate ‘walk-in’ applications.” Zondo added that the bachelor of education and the bachelor of science received the most applications from students. “The bachelor of education received 38  577 applications and the bachelor of science received 35  867 applications.” Minister of Higher Education and Training Dr Blade Nzimande said that he was happy that in the 2022 matric class 278  815 students had achieved a bachelor’s pass, 197  357 (26.7%) achieved a diploma pass, and 14.9% (108 159) achieved a higher certificate pass. This in spite of the fact that this class faced significant challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic and load shedding. Nzimande said the Department Higher Education and Training was hoping to enrol more than 556 450 students at Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges nationally. “Prospective students need to contact TVET colleges and enquire about spaces and available programmes.” Nzimande said registration for public universities for the 2023 academic year began on January 16 and was expected to close on February 20. “However, there are several universities that will allow late registration that include Cape Peninsula University of Technology, DUT, MUT, Rhodes University, University of Fort Hare, Walter Sisulu University, TUT and University of Zululand. “I want to stress this does not mean that prospective students need to relax. They need to start making enquiries now about available places and programmes.” He said that 1 112 439 students were projected to enrol for the 2023 academic year nationally, which was an increase of 41 545 students from the 2022 academic year. There were also 208 299 first-time students projected to enrol nationally. THE MERCURY
