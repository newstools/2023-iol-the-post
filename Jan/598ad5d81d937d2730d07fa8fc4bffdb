The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) has obtained a restraint order against a KwaZulu-Natal doctor, his wife and three others accused of defrauding the South African Revenue Service (Sars) of about R30 million. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson in KZN, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, said the state is alleging that Pietermaritzburg doctor Navind Dayanand, his wife Nerupa Dayanand along with Douglas Mpofu, Carla Domenica Louden and Yagasami Ronnie Perumal submitted false Corporate Income Tax, Value Added Tax and Personal Income Tax returns  to Sars so that the doctor and the hospital could obtain undue tax refunds and/or not pay due taxes to the value of approximately R39 million. She said the AFU obtained an interim restraint order against the accused. “The assets stipulated in the order include items from the hospital such as furniture, vehicles, computers and electrical, medical and electronic equipment. The order also mentions immovable properties.  “The assets will be held under the curatorship of the appointed curator until the order is confirmed," Ramkisson-Kara said. She said the criminal matter returns to court on February 24 when all the accused are expected to appear. IOL
