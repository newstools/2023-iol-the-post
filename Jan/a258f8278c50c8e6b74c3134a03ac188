Durban – A Pedros employee who bagged seven distinctions in his matric exam has been awarded a R10 000 bursary from them.  Pedros in Verulam on the KZN North Coast took to social media to celebrate Siyabonga Magwaza’s outstanding feat.  “Our very own Siyabonga Magwaza, from Pedros Verulam, achieved seven distinctions in the 2022 National Senior Certificate Examinations, so Pedros has pledged R10 000 towards his future studies.  “Congratulations Siya. You are part of the winning team. We know you’ll succeed in whatever career path you choose.”  The post has since gone viral on social media with social media users welcoming the kind gesture.  Pranitha Berchu: “When you grow humanity you grow your business. Well done to the matriculant. Well done for your generosity.” Hima Jugnarayan: “Absolutely brilliant!
