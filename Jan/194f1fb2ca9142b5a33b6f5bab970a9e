Durban — Two pedestrians were killed within a kilometre of each other on Monday morning in Durban. Spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said at about 10am Emer-G-Med paramedics responded to two incidents on the M19 eastbound where pedestrians had been struck by light motor vehicles. “In the first incident, a female approximately 60 years of age was knocked down in an alleged hit-and-run. She suffered fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics,” Van Reenen said. “In the second incident, just metres up the road under the N2 interchange, a male in his late twenties was struck by a Volkswagen Polo. “He too sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics,” Van Reenen said. Meanwhile, two people were killed and two others injured in a crash also on the M19 near Reservoir Hills, just after 11pm on Saturday. ALS Paramedics Medical Services director Garrith Jamieson said when paramedics arrived at the scene, they found total carnage. Two vehicles had collided on the roadway before one vehicle left the roadway coming to rest down an embankment. “A female in her twenties was found entrapped in the wreckage. She was quickly assessed on the scene. However, she had sustained fatal injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for her and she was declared dead on the scene,” Jamieson said. “The driver, a male in his twenties, was also found entrapped in the wreckage with critical injuries. He was stabilised on the scene by advanced life support paramedics before being rushed through to a nearby Durban hospital for further treatment. He however went into a state of cardiac arrest and despite doctors’ attempts to resuscitate him, his injuries were too severe and he was declared dead at the hospital.” Jamieson said two other patients from the other vehicle sustained moderate to serious injuries and were stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby Durban hospital. Police have been approached for comment. Daily News
