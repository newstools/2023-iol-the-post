Durban — A man was taken to the hospital after sustaining a spinal injury when he dived into a tidal pool in Ballito, on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Medi Response spokesperson Paul Herbst said KwaDukuza municipality lifeguards together with Medi Response advanced life support paramedics and search and rescue division responded to the scene at Clark Bay tidal pool where a man sustained a spinal injury. “Crews responded to the incident and on arrival ascertained that a man had dived into the pool and struck his head on a rock,” Herbst said. He said the man was in a serious condition and was treated by advanced life support paramedics before being transported to the hospital. Meanwhile, in a similar incident last September, a middle-aged man had to be airlifted to a medical facility in northern KwaZulu-Natal after misjudging a dive and hitting his head at the bottom of a swimming pool. Start Rescue spokesperson Warren Brauns said Start St Lucia teams were activated following reports of an individual, 53, who had slipped and fallen into a pool at a lodge. “On arrival, the patient was assessed and it was found that the patient had dived into a pool and misjudged depth hitting their head on the bottom of the pool,” Brauns said. “Due to the nature of the injury, it was suspected that the patient had suffered severe head and spinal injuries, a decision was made to activate Start partner Netcare 911's NC7 for rapid transportation to a medical facility for the treatment the patient would require.” Brauns said.
