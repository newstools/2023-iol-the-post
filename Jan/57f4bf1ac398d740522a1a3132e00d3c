Durban - Msunduzi Municipality mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla visited the family of an eight-year-old child who was swept off a bridge in Peace Valley by floodwaters on Friday. In a statement on the mop-up operations taking place on Saturday following the heavy rains in the province on Thursday and Friday, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs said disaster management teams were still trying to recover the body of the missing child. The municipality said the mayor had offered his support to the family as law enforcement continued with the search for the child. “We urge residents to avoid using low-lying bridges and to evacuate areas that are a great danger when there are heavy rains,” said Thebolla. Thebolla reiterated that these incidents could be avoided if residents practised caution. “We are looking to close this bridge so as not to have an incident of this nature in future,” he added.   The municipality said disaster management teams were undertaking inspections in areas where damage was reported. With regard to cases of sewer manholes that were overflowing with rainwater and blocked stormwater drains in and around the Edendale area, the municipality said teams from sanitation and roads were on the ground attending to those issues to ensure roads were accessible. “We are appealing to motorists to drive safely and be extra cautious when travelling on roads, as potholes may be filled with water and there may be sinkholes,” said the municipality.
