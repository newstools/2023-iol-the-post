Durban - An FNB customer was robbed at gunpoint by two suspects at the bank’s uMhlanga branch over a week ago. Spokesperson and CEO of FNB Points of Presence,  Lee-Anne van Zyl, confirmed that a customer was accosted at the uMhlanga branch in KwaZulu-Natal. “The customer was not physically harmed during the incident and the police were immediately called to the scene,” said Van Zyl. She said FNB was co-operating with the police investigation on the matter. “In light of the pending investigation, we are unable to provide further details,” she said. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala confirmed Durban North police were investigating the case. Gwala said a 49-year-old man was robbed at gunpoint. “It is alleged that the victim was on his way to deposit money at the bank in uMhlanga when he was accosted by two armed men. At gunpoint they robbed him and fled the scene,” she said. Gwala said the suspects allegedly took an undisclosed amount of cash and drove off in their gateway vehicle. Last year a man was robbed while heading to a bank in the Pinetown area. In that incident, the man was jumping out his vehicle on his way to the bank when he was accosted by two armed men. At gunpoint, they robbed him of an undisclosed amount of cash and drove away in their gateway vehicle, Gwala said at the time. THE MERCURY
