Durban – The Msunduzi Municipality has urged residents not to share fake news after a warning about disruptive weather conditions was issued by the SA Weather Service. The municipality spokesperson Ntobeko Mkhize said Msunduzi was among the places mentioned by the SAWS that may be affected by severe weather conditions.  The weather service issued a level 9 warning for Msunduzi and other areas for disruptive rainfall which may lead to flooding on Thursday and Friday. “The Disaster Management Teams have been placed on high alert following the warning of disruptive weather conditions affecting Msunduzi among other areas,” she said. Mkhize also urged residents to refrain from sharing misinformation and fake news regarding weather conditions. “The city discourages the circulation of old videos and images as that may cause unnecessary panic,” she said. She also said residents should exercise extreme precaution as the continued rain will increase the risk of flooding in low-lying areas.  “We appeal to motorists and pedestrians to avoid crossing swollen rivers, low-lying bridges, and walkways,” added Mkhize. The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs said on Wednesday that the Provincial Disaster Management Centre has activated the Joint Operations Committee (JOC). It said that the JOC will meet daily with all disaster management teams from municipalities to take stock of the situation.  THE MERCURY
