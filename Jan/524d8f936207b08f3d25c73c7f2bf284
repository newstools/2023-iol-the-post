Durban — The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport launched a R300 million road upgrade project in the Umdoni Municipality in the Ugu District. Construction is expected to start on the Main Road P77 linking Scottburgh under uGu and the Harry Gwala districts. The road will be upgraded from gravel to tar with the first 17 km of the road having already (been) surfaced and the second phase to be upgraded will be 10 km. This main road is expected to connect the community of uMdoni Local Municipality with important amenities such as schools, clinics, public transport and other business opportunities. The 10 km will connect two traditional councils – the Zembeni and Bele traditional councils. Traditional House of Leadership INkosi Mqadi, who has lived in the area for over 20 years, said they were pleased the request was finally attended to.  Mqadi said numerous letters were written to various departments in vain. Cars were often getting damaged every now and then due to the road conditions. We even had challenges when ambulances were responding to emergencies. It was difficult for them to get to people. These roads also caused a number of accidents,” said Mqadi. Ugu District House of Traditional Leaders chairperson Ngcobo added that the community no longer had to fight for basic needs. He said although there was a lot that needed to be done, they were grateful for the commitment shown by the department. “We recently experienced severe rains, but the MEC did not stop the project. I have hope that small businesses will know this creates job opportunities for them and the community,” said Ngcobo. MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Sipho Hlomuka said the project included a road which combines three wards. The project was expected to begin on February 20. He emphasised that the contractor would create job opportunities for locals as per the terms and conditions. WhatsApp your views on this story at 071 485 7995 Daily News
