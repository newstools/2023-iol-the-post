Durban -The Premier of KwaZulu-Natal Nomusa Dube-Ncube will on Thursday officiate the launch of an innovative project to assist disadvantaged schools to have an uninterrupted supply of water for consumption and sanitation at Zwelibanzi High School in uMlazi. The office of the Premier said that the programme is spearheaded by alcohol company, Diageo South Africa.  “The leading alcohol manufacturer, has partnered with a non-governmental organisation, Triple P, to repair and maintain water infrastructure in 17 schools in uMlazi and surrounding townships,” it said. The office of the Premier added that the initiative is aimed at ensuring that as the 2023 academic year gets under way, schools do not experience disruptions to their programme due to shortages of water owing to leakages. “The project has recorded a saving of 14 million litres of potable water per year – which is about 800 000 litres of water that would have been lost per school, per year due to water leakages,” it said. The provincial government said that schools, particularly in under-resourced areas, experience interruptions to their programme owing to water shortages due to ageing infrastructure. “Research shows that South Africa faces a water shortage which, should it continue unabated, will lead to the country experiencing a water deficit of 17% by 2030. “Water leaks are responsible for 37% of potable water loss in the country and eThekwini Municipality has recorded losses of at least 50% of its potable water due to leaks,” it said. The event will also include a donation of school shoes from Diageo employees to all pupils of Zwelibanzi High School. THE MERCURY
