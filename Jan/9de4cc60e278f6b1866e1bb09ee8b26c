Durban – The eThekwini Municipality embarked on a clean-up campaign in the Pinetown CBD this week which focuses on cleanliness, compliance and safety issues. In updates on the campaign, which were posted on the city’s Facebook page on Monday, the municipality said a series of non-compliance issues and food safety concerns were noted at food outlets operating in the Pinetown central business district during inspections by environmental health officers. “Among the main transgressions were dirty working conditions, the lack of provision of protective clothing for workers, no protection from dust, and swarms of flies at the food outlets.”    The municipality said one of the food outlets, which sells shawarmas, was fined for non-compliance with health standards. The outlet is also operating without a business licence.   “The Health Unit’s environmental officers are visiting food outlets in Pinetown to conduct inspections to ensure compliance.” Workers also tackled the corner of Moodie and Chapel streets, said the municipality, with municipal volunteers providing a helping hand to ensure the success of the campaign.   The municipality said city officials also inspected informal traders’ spaces in Stanfield Avenue. “The Mother Of All Clean Ups continues in the heart of Pinetown, city officials inspecting informal traders’ spaces in Stanfield Avenue, Pinetown. They (are) focusing on cleanliness, compliance and issues of safety. Metro police is also issuing fines to motorists who do not comply with the rules of the road.”   Meanwhile, the city said a team from the Roads and Stormwater Department were hard at work patching Dales Avenue.
