Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a body of an unknown male believed to be in his thirties was recovered at Cuttings Beach on Monday morning. “An inquest docket has been opened at Isipingo SAPS for investigation,” Gwala said. Meanwhile, last month, the body of an unidentified man was found on Umdloti beach. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Durban North police had opened an inquest after the body of an unknown man was recovered at Umdloti on Tuesday, 20 December. According to the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Tongaat’s Nazir Sadack, they suspected that the body could be a missing swimmer because it did not seem that he had been in the water long. That would form part of the police investigation. CERT said that volunteers responded to Umdloti Beach, where according to reports, a body was seen floating. CERT said that upon the arrival of the volunteers, it was confirmed to be a body. The body of an unidentified adult male was retrieved by CERT volunteers and eThekwini lifeguards. The incident happened days after a freak wave had washed several people out to sea. This left three people dead and 17 injured. Daily News
