Durban — The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal has warned the public and applicants for the national school nutrition programme tender to be on the lookout for scammers. This follows voice notes doing the rounds on social media platforms saying that those who have applied for the programme should submit their names through certain individuals. In the first voice note received by the Daily News, the voice of a man is heard saying: "Greetings, comrades! If there is someone who owns a company that is registered or has applied for the tender of feeding children in schools, I want them to contact me – it is urgent.“ In the other voice note, another man says: "Dear secretaries, one must say compliments of the new year. Secretaries, I need help here. There is this tender of nutrition. I am urging you all to share the contact details of all the comrades that applied for this tender to feed the pupils in schools. I will need the company name, contact person and contact number of the person. I beg you, comrades. It’s a matter of urgency." KZN Education’s spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said the department distanced itself from the voice notes. He said they were a scam and urged the public to refer exclusively to the department’s official pages for information. "We are saying this is a scam. Do not be fooled by scammers. We are directing you to follow the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education's official social media networks for updates at all times," said Mahlambi. Daily News
