Durban - Nombuyiselo Gwiji, who is serving a life sentence at the Westville Correctional Centre, wants to pursue a PhD degree after being awarded a Master’s degree in education. Gwiji, who matriculated in 1996, was sentenced in 2015 and enrolled for her honours degree in education at the University of Free State in 2019.  She said the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 interrupted her studies but she resumed with the course the following year. In the same year she passed her Honours degree. Gwiji, who refused to divulge the reason for her imprisonment, received a special mention at an event to celebrate inmates who passed their 2022 matric exams.  She told The Mercury that studying behind bars was not easy even though inmates received a lot of attention and help from teachers. “Learning from the inside is not easy. I do not want to lie, you just have to be motivated as a person. Some officials are always willing to help you, all you need to do is show willingness and respect. Even though you have enough time in prison, you must learn time management, you cannot afford to relax,” Gwiji said. The 44-year-old from Matatiele lauded the support she received from prison officials, saying she was eternally grateful to them.  The principal of  Female Higher Education at Westville Correctional Centre, Thabile Luthuli, described Gwiji’s achievement as “brilliant” especially due to the challenges she faced. “Learning in prison is not easy. There is gangsterism and drugs, but we always get support from the bosses. There is no gap between me and my students – we always try to help each other. It is important for students to respect teachers who are assisting them,” said Luthuli. KZN Education MEC Mbali Frazer said Gwiji had set a good example for other inmates. “We are very proud of students like Gwiji who despite all odds achieved their goals. Her success is a reminder to other inmates that no matter how hard you fall you must always pick yourself up,” Frazer said. THE MERCURY
