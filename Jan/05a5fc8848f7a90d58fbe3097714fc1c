Durban — Three videos of a suspected contractor defecating on a resident’s driveway have been shared on social media, but the commentary on the video wins. The videos were taken after 1pm on Wednesday, January 4, 2023. In the videos, one can see the suspected contractor, another worker, a white bakkie with blue pipes on top and a dug up area near a driveway, assumed to be where they had been working or were about to work. In one of the videos, the contractor is standing closer to the house, believed to be the driveway, and takes his pants off. The voice, a man behind the video, then says, “this ou is actually preparing to s**t. Municipality contract worker, too.” “Curry bum.” At least two women are also in the background with the man. The women laugh throughout the videos, and although they speak, at times, they are inaudible. After taking his pants off, the contractor then takes his underwear off. “This is what goes on in South Africa,” the man said. “This is what we have to go through.” The contractor then moons the camera while he appears to be picking up something from the driveway. Meanwhile, the worker he is with is seen moving in and out of the bakkie. “Contract workers,” the man’s voice said. The contractor then bends over and appears to be picking up his faeces. “Sies!” he exclaimed. He then grabbed a newspaper from the ground and wiped his bum. “Wipe the bum,” the voice said. In another video, the voice says “wipe up after you s**t. Disgraceful”. In a third video, the contractor grabs another piece of paper and wipes his bum again. “And the garage is up the road. “He s***s right here, in front of the resident’s house. “Sies, man! Sies!” the man’s voice said. It is believed the bakkie had faeces om it because the contractor leaned on it after defecating. “... Contract workers, water,” the man’s voice said. “This is what we have to put up with… spreading E. coli… Sies, man!” Daily News
