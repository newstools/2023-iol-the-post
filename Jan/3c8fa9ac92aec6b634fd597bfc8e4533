Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Ms Nomagugu Simelane has urged men aged 50 and over to get screened and tested for prostate cancer.

The department added research had shown that due to genetic factors and socio-economic status, the risk of prostate cancer was higher among black men. Prostate cancer also tends to run in families, making it vital for men to know their family cancer history, especially where there was prostate or breast cancer in a first degree family relative, according to the Cancer Association of South Africa. Speaking on the department’s weekly KZN Health Chat multimedia programme recently, Simelane urged the public to move away from myths such as that cancer is caused by “witchcraft,” but rather initiate and have truthful conversations about cancer to prevent deaths. “As we begin the year, we are encouraging all men aged 50 and above, and those aged 45 and above who have a history of prostate cancer in the family, to start on a clean slate by getting screened and tested for prostate cancer.
