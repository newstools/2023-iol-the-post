Durban — Three men who were arrested in KwaZulu-Natal for the alleged possession of three unlicensed firearms and ammunition were travelling in a car stolen in Gauteng last year. KZN Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said on Wednesday, Hawks members from Newcastle Serious Organised Crime Investigation, working together with Amajuba District members and Newcastle Trio Crime Task Team, arrested three suspects, aged 27, 28 and 33, over possession of unlicensed firearms in the Annieville area in Dannhauser, northern KZN. Mhlongo said that the members had received information about the suspects possessing unlicensed firearms in the area. A joint operation was conducted and members spotted the suspects’ motor vehicle. It was intercepted and a search was conducted. “The suspects were found in possession of three unlicensed firearms and live rounds of ammunition,” Mhlongo said. “It was also established that their vehicle was stolen at Katlehong in Gauteng last year.” Mhlongo said that the suspects were arrested and charged accordingly.
