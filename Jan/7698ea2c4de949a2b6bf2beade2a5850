Durban – The body of a child was found in the Glendale area in a grassy field on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast on Wednesday. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said its Search and Rescue team received a call from a local farmer, who believed that he had discovered a body. “Upon arrival of IPSS Medical, it was quickly established that it was indeed the body of a young child,” he said. Meyrick said the area was quickly cordoned off while they waited for the police to arrive. At this time the young victim remains unidentified, he said. “We want to thank Glendale SAPS for their continued investigation and to the local farmer for alerting authorities,” said Meyrick. Police have been approached for comment.  Concerns have been raised about the recent murders of children. Earlier this month, six-year-old Anele Sphengane, from the Mayville area, was found murdered in eNkanini. KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokesperson Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder and rape had been opened at the Cato Manor police station in connection with her death. Last week the IFP expressed outrage over child killings following the murder of seven-year-old Philasande Shange, who went missing while playing with other children in Ntshawini, KwaDukuza, on January 5. “We cannot continue as normal when senseless acts of violence are perpetrated against our most vulnerable. There is an African proverb that calls on us all to collectively protect our children: 'It takes a village to raise a child'.  “Now, more than ever, with the challenges of single parenthood, grandmother-headed homes and child-headed homes, we have to lend practical articulation to this and ensure that we support those to whom our children are entrusted,” said IFP National Women's Brigade chairperson Princess Buthelezi.
