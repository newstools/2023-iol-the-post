Durban - Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sihle Zikalala has described former Ugu District Municipality mayor Phumlile Mthiyane, as a “bridge-builder, peacemaker, and passionate activist who put the interests of the people of Ugu first”. Mthiyane who became mayor in December 2021, died unexpectedly in the early hours of Monday morning, the municipality said. She died just days after the Ugu municipal manager Dr Elliot Ntombela died on Saturday after being hospitalised for more than three weeks due to illness. Zikalala said Mthiyane’s passing had left the provincial government “devastated and in disbelief”. The MEC said the district had lost a gentle giant in the sphere of local government who took on the task of stabilising the supply of water for communities within the district. “Within a very short period of time following her appointment as mayor, we saw progress on key projects meant to improve water supply,” he said. Zikalala said this progress was a testimony to Mthiyane’s ability to bring people together in the pursuit of a common goal. “We mourn the loss of a bridge-builder, peacemaker, and passionate activist who put the interests of the people of Ugu first. “We convey our condolences to the Mthiyane family and all the staff of the Ugu District and the family of municipalities under it,” he said.
