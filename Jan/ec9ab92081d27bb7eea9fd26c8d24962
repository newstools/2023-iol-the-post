Durban - Traffic volumes on the N3 heading to Gauteng are expected to peak as many holidaymakers make their way home. Thania Dhoogra, operations manager of the N3 Toll Concession, said motorists should be aware of the high traffic volumes on the N3 toll route.  “Road users are advised to plan ahead and be prepared for peak traffic conditions on the N3 toll route as volumes in excess of 1 300 vehicles per hour along the route have been recorded heading northbound towards Gauteng. Increased volumes in excess of 1 500 vehicles per hour are expected, which will place additional pressure on road users, law enforcement, and emergency services,” she said. Dhoogra added that the N3TC is urging motorists to abide by the road rules and practise safe driving. “Law enforcement officials will continue to monitor the route to ensure that motorists are following the rules and emergency services are patrolling the route so as to be able to respond speedily to any emergency situation. “N3TC appeals to all road users to partner with us in ensuring the safety, convenience, and mobility of everyone on the N3 toll route by adhering to the rules of the road by buckling up, ensuring that you are visible to other road users at all times, and sharing the road responsibly,” said Dhoogra.
