Heatwave conditions are expected to persist over KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape and Eastern Cape for the next few days. “A heatwave with persistently high temperatures is expected over north-eastern parts of the Eastern Cape until Wednesday but it will last until Thursday in KZN,” the South African Weather Service (SAWS) said. It said an extremely high fire danger warning has been issued for the northern and central parts of the Northern Cape. “Very hot temperatures will result in uncomfortable conditions over Khai-Ma in the Northern Cape, and the central interior of the Western Cape where temperatures are expected to reach 40°C.  “However, over the southern parts of the West Coast including the City of Cape Town, temperatures between 30°C and 35°C are likely to occur together with high humidity,” SAWS said.
