Durban – Over the past few weeks, security officers contracted to uMhlathuze Local Municipality have disposed of a large quantity of confiscated alcohol at Alkantstrand Beach in Richards Bay according to Ward 2 councillor, Christo Botha. Botha posted a video on his Facebook page on Wednesday which shows security guards pouring out alcohol from several bottles. “Alcohol is not allowed at Alkantstrand and during the past few weeks security officers confiscated and destroyed a substantial amount of alcoholic beverages,” he said. Botha said the video clip that he shared was just one of many similar interventions.   “Please note that this post does not suggest that there was a 100% success rate. We merely aim to provide some photographic material of the operations that took place,” he said. Speaking to “The Mercury” yesterday (Thursday), Botha said all the confiscated alcohol was destroyed by security officers employed by security companies contracted to the City. “No alcohol is confiscated and retained,” he said. Botha further explained that the various contracted security companies liaise with senior municipal officials to ensure compliance with City by-laws. “Also, the manager in charge of the particular security company who is responsible for law enforcement on Alkantstrand and surrounding beach areas, attends all relevant beach management, and other planning meetings in respect of the various festive seasons events, and access to the beaches,” he added.
