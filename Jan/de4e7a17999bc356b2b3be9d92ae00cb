Durban - Students looking to further their studies, have been urged to carefully research colleges before they apply to ensure they are legally registered and offer accredited qualifications. The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Dr Blade Nzimande, has warned students and parents not to be taken advantage of by illegal or “fly-by-night” colleges as they look to pursue tertiary education this year. He said illegal colleges are not registered as institutions of learning with the correct Sector Education and Training Authorities (Setas), the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) or other relevant bodies. “These institutions lure and mislead future students into believing that these colleges offer qualifications that are recognised by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA),” said Nzimande. “These illegal colleges offer compromised qualifications which are not recognised for employment purposes or for further studying,” he added. Nzimande said that the department has been successful in shutting down some of these illegal operators. “However, whilst the department may be hard at work in eliminating these unregistered colleges, there are still many students who continue to register and are unlawfully granted fake qualifications.” However he added that the number of colleges that are operating illegally has decreased tremendously over the years.  “The decrease can be attributed to our monitoring awareness campaigns and our collaboration with both print and electronic media,” said Nzimande. Nzimande advises students who want to enrol at private colleges to check the registration status of private colleges with the department through its toll-free number: 0800 872 222. Alternatively, students can log on to the department’s website where the ‘Register of Private Colleges’ is published and updated on a regular basis. THE MERCURY
