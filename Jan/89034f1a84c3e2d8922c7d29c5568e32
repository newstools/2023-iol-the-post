Durban - Local snake catcher Nick Evans said he received a call from his friends at Monkey Helpline in Durban on Saturday to remove a black mamba from the front door area. Evans said the organisation is run by Steve Smit and Carol Booth, who specialise in rescuing vervet monkeys around the greater Durban area. They also rescue other animals that need help. Smit had spotted the mamba trying to gain access into the house. However, it was obstructed by a glass sliding door, he said. “He (Smit) scared it off into a small tree by their front door, where he, Carol, volunteers and the cats kept a close eye on the snake,” he said. Evans warned that cats are not a deterrent for black mambas. “Small mambas can be a bit tricky. They’re fast and can be feisty. But fortunately, this was a relatively easy catch. “A 1.4m specimen. I see very few of this size, although I did see that 90cm specimen earlier this month,” he said.   In a separate incident on Thursday, Evans said a black mamba died after being run over by a vehicle on a busy road near Glenmore. He said the person who called for assistance tried to frantically wave approaching cars away from the snake. “Unfortunately, I could see the snake was taking its last breaths. No visible injuries, as often is the case with these large snakes and cars. But there was blood in the mouth. ‘I love snakes,’ said the caller. It was a pity his efforts were in vain when it came to the snake’s life. However, his care and effort gave me hope. Seeing someone with an attitude like his, especially going out of his way, probably being late for work, to try and save an animal, was so good to see,” said Evans. Evans said the body will be used for an interesting research project they’re working on, to help better understand and conserve black mambas. THE MERCURY
