Durban snake catcher Nick Evans removed a Mozambique spitting cobra from a friend’s place. Evans said he picked up the little Mozambique spitting cobra from a friend’s place on Tuesday night in Queensburgh. “Quite a peculiar place to see one,” Evans said. “The snake did not appreciate having its photo taken, and spat all over my phone.” Reacting to the incident, Tessa Pieterse Cooper said: “It's braai time ... 'spit’ braai to be exact.” Lalitha Anaruth said: “Good catch Nick Evans and team although the snake looked like it was in a difficult place to catch – and awesome pics.” Roy Griffin said: “Jirrrre in the grill nogal, don’t think it liked your phone, but good catch Nick, well done.” Catheleen Oosthuizen said: “Braai snake … just joking Nick! Just want to say you are doing awesome work regarding snake rescues.” Recently, Evans was in the Westville North area for a black mamba but had to return for another snake which turned out to be a Mozambique spitting cobra. He said the snake was under a large pet rat enclosure on a verandah. “I was relieved to see that, again, the homeowners had locked their dogs away, keeping them safe,” Evans said. “I looked under, with a suspicion it would be a Mozambique spitting cobra, and it was. I was a bit disappointed. These are beautiful snakes, with the most incredible way of defending themselves. However, I do not like being on the receiving end of their venom shower. Plus, I love mambas!” Evans said he managed to pin the snake down without being spat at. “It's actually not too long, around 1.2m, but so chunky! A very well-fed animal,” Evans said. Daily News
