Returning to local stages, the Dingalings are set to kick off a tour of their new show in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend. Dingalings are Back!, will stage on Saturday, January 28, at Golden Horse Casino. Kumseela Naidoo, a spokesperson for Dingalings, said their latest offering stars Koobeshen Naidoo and Henry Ramkisoon as they treat their audience to a fusion of music from yesteryear and lots of laughter. “Dingalings are Back! is a brand-new show. It celebrates the return of Durban’s popular comedians to popular venues where their brand of comedy is well loved. We plan to perform the same show at other venues in the near future.” Naidoo said the show will cover feel-good stories from yesteryear. “These will be told as only as a Dingaling could. They cover the age-old question on why men love fishing and of course relationship advice for women – wives, girlfriends and daughters – told in true Dingalings style. They will also perform popular Dingalings bangra and Chutney singalong songs. We played last at this venue in March of 2021, just before the big lockdown, so PMB audiences are in for a treat,” said Naidoo. *Tickets are R150 from Webtickets. Shows are 5pm and 8pm. There is a 16 age restriction. POST
