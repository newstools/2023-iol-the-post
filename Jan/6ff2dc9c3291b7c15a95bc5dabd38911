Durban - The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) said it would like to correct the misleading comments on social media that its chairperson Thembani Bukula has a conflict of interest related to electricity tariff approvals. On Thursday, Nersa announced that it had approved a 18.65% electricity tariff increase for 2023/2024, Eskom had requested a 32% hike. The tariff increase in the midst of Stage 6 load shedding has led to public outrage with some taking to social media to raise their concerns including questions about Bukula’s alleged conflict of interest. But Nersa spokesperson Charles Hlebela, in a statement on Saturday said Bukula was not conflicted. “He resigned from his position as non-executive director of Mahube Infrastructure upon his appointment as Nersa chairperson,” said Hlebela. Hlebela said the law required that upon appointment every part-time regulator member (board member) disclose to the minister of mineral resources and energy his (or her) pecuniary interest in any company (firm or association) engaged in the electricity, piped-gas and petroleum pipelines industries. He said Bukula, as a part-time regulator member, had duly complied in this regard and did declare his interests before taking over his position. Hlebela further explained that the Energy Regulator (board) consists of nine members that make decisions on applications from Nersa licensees including Eskom. The decisions of the Energy Regulator are solely based on the thorough analysis of the application as well as facts and evidence presented to the Energy Regulator, he said. “In accordance with the law, there is no pecuniary interest that Mr Bukula stands to benefit pursuant to all decisions taken by the Energy Regulator,” said Hlebela.
