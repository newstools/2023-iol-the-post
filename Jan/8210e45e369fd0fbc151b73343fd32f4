Durban – The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) says bathers and shoreline anglers can expect changes in the high and low tides until the peak of the full moon spring tide on Friday. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said in a statement on New Year’s Day that visitors to the coast will notice that the high tides will gradually get higher than normal and the low tides will gradually retreat to lower than normal. He said these changes in the tides could be expected in the lead up to the peak of the full moon spring tide on January 6. “The concern is that coastal bathers and shoreline anglers who are not aware of the full moon (and new moon) spring tides will be caught off guard,” he said. He said rip currents can be stronger in places during a spring tide. “We are appealing to coastal bathers and shoreline anglers to be cautious, and bathers should only swim at beaches protected by lifeguards, [and] swim in the safe swimming areas that lifeguards earmark using their red and yellow flags,” said Lambinon.
