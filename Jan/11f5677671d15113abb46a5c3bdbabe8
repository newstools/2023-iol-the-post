Durban- KwaZulu-Natal Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube has embarked on a drive to recruit young people across the province and train them to be repair technicians as part of the Smart Connected Province initiative. On Thursday the government said the Smart Connected Province project, which is Dube-Ncube’s legacy, is bearing fruit. The aim of the project is to shift focus to a digital economy, robotics, drone technology and mechatronics as well as other technologies, said the government statement. The statement said the KZN provincial government, led by the premier, has partnered with Sanchaa Connection to teach people how to repair, maintain and refurbish smart devices. “The recruitment drive started on the 10th of January 2023, and so far it has recruited more than 300 young people at Esikhawini Sports Centre. “On the 11th of January 2023 the recruitment drive proceeded to the rural community of eNyanyatu to a church called Dorset Presbyterian Church of Africa and Sibongile township in Dundee. At eNhlanhleni Care Centre, 200 young people were recruited.” On Thursday, the recruitment drive was held at the Bhukanana post office with the focus on 100 young people. “While being trained on the three-month course, young people will receive a monthly stipend of R1 500.” The provincial government said during training, the young people will gain practical skills which will enable them to implement the skills they acquired in the business field. The government said the province, in partnership with Spoornet, will be converting close to 50 containers that will be used as digital centres. “(The containers) will be distributed throughout the province, targeting rural areas and areas where young people are most affected by unemployment.”     THE MERCURY
