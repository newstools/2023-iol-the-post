Durban — A kite surfer broke his leg while out at sea in uMhlanga on Sunday afternoon. Medi Response spokesperson Paul Herbst said that earlier on Sunday afternoon, Medi Response responded to a beach in uMhlanga following reports of an injured kite surfer. “On arrival of our rescue unit and ambulance, it was established that a kite surfer had broken his leg whilst kite surfing. The injured man managed to make his way to shore and summon help,” Herbst said. “Advanced life support paramedics attended to the man, packaging him to be carried off of the beach and to an awaiting ambulance.” Herbst added that the man was transported to the hospital for definitive care. Meanwhile, last month IPSS Medical Response spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said the IPSS Medical Rescue Search and Rescue division along with IPSS paramedics responded to a scene at a Ballito beach for a near drowning. Meyrick said that on the arrival of paramedics, the man had already been pulled from the water by KwaDukuza Municipality (KDM) lifeguards and fellow surfers who were actively rendering aid. He said that reports from the scene indicated that the man began experiencing difficulty in the water when he was dumped by a large wave and subsequently hit with his surfboard. The man is currently under the care of one of IPSS Medical Rescue advanced life support paramedics and will be taken to a nearby facility for further care. Meyrick thanked the man’s fellow surfers, KDM lifeguards and Ballito UIP members for their assistance on the scene. Daily News
