Durban – Socks, a cat that went missing a month ago in the stormwater drainage system near its owner’s house in Ballito has been rescued. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said in a statement on Sunday that the search and rescue division alongside the Specialised Rescue Unit received a call from a resident stating she could hear her missing cat. The cat has been missing for a month in a drain near her residence, he said. “Rescue teams got to work closing off the various drains in order to ensure the cat doesn't flee further into the drainage system,” said Meyrick.   He said thaT after much coaxing, members managed to recover the cat after a two-day operation. “Despite being a bit worse for wear, Socks managed to escape his ordeal with a few scratches,” said Meyrick. “Many thanks to the Specialised Rescue Unit for their assistance, to Nathi from Dolphin Coast SPCA – Ballito and to Marinelli Plumbing for their assistance and use of their specialised camera equipment.” “The Mercury” reported last week on an incident where a kitten was stuck in a drain pipe in Pietermaritzburg. The Pietermaritzburg SPCA’s trainee Inspector Wandile Xaba went to see how they could assist. According to the SPCA, food was put down to try and coax the kitten out which didn’t work and as other attempts were made to reach the kitten, it moved further back. “The only thing left to do was to dig until the pipe was visible and then try to reach the kitten from there.” The SPCA said the SPCA officials as well as members of the family to which the kitten belonged to got to work digging. Eventually the kitten was rescued but it was covered in mud and scared.   THE MERCURY
