Durban - Thousands have signed a petition seeking to keep an Eastern Cape Zion Church bishop behind bars. He has been charged over the murder of his daughter. Madumandile Nogaga, who allegedly strangled his 13-year-old daughter, Azile Nogaga, with a wire hanger, was due to appear in court on Thursday.  Many community members fear that if Nogaga is released, his wife, Khunjulwa Nogaga, would be in grave danger. When the murder occurred in November, Khunjulwa had a protection order and a domestic violence case opened against her husband.  However, on the day of the killing, he allegedly ignored the order and was able to access his wife’s home. Azile was changing her clothes, preparing to accompany her mother to her grandmother’s house, when her father caught off guard and allegedly strangled her. The pastor went to a nearby family house where he allegedly used a stick to beat a three-year-old relative.  Butterworth police arrested him. Asonele Melapi, from the Baphi Abafazi Movement (BAM), a woman’s rights movement, started a petition on Tuesday, to help keep the bishop in custody. “His living children and the community fear his return as they do not feel safe in his presence anymore. He is an abusive man who has tried multiple times to have his wife murdered. In his failure to do so, he then turned to his 13-year-old daughter and she was, unfortunately, not as lucky as her mother,” said Melapi.  “The young girl had aspirations to be a doctor and now she will no longer have that opportunity as she has lost her innocent life due to the actions of her father.” Melapi said the girl’s family were not coping and they want Madumile to be punished for his actions. “He is currently at Butterworth Prison and we urge you to sign this petition, that he does not receive bail and remains in police custody during the commencement and remainder of his trial.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
