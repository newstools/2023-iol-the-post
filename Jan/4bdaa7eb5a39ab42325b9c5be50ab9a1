Durban — A suspect was arrested for drug dealing and the possession of drugs in Phoenix, north of Durban recently. Durban Metro Police Service spokesperson Senior Superintendent Boysie Zungu said the suspect was arrested when the Durban Metro Police Service drug team conducted an operation on a drugs transporter in Phoenix. “The target was stopped and searched where drugs were seized,” Zungu said. He said that the male was arrested for dealing and the possession of suspected heroin. He was processed at the Phoenix police station. “The exhibits seized were 400 suspected heroin capsules with a value of R8 000,” Zungu said. Last week, the Durban Metro Police Service’s tactical support unit arrested a suspect in Primula Drive in the Mobeni Heights area. Zungu said that the suspect, 37, was arrested for being in possession of 15 capsules of suspected heroin with a street value of R380, as well as R700 in cash. He said the suspect was processed at Bayview police station. “The suspect was arrested by SAPS Durban POP on January 9, 2023, on a Bayview CAS number. “He thereafter relocated his drug operation to Primula Drive Mobeni Heights. Suspect was under observation and he was arrested for dealing suspected heroin,” Zungu said. Two weeks ago, Zungu said that after the police service received numerous complaints from the Montford community in Chatsworth, an operation team was set up for the Montford shopping centre in Chatsworth and observation was carried out by Durban metro police officers at Road 736. “One suspected Asian male, 45 years old, was searched and one piece of crack cocaine in his top pocket was found,” Zungu said. “A further search was carried out and 61 heroin capsules were found in the suspect's groin area.” Zungu said that the suspect was taken to Chatsworth police station and charged with being in possession of crack cocaine and heroin.
