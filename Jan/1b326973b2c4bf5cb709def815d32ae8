Durban – A man and a woman believed to be in their early twenties died tragically in a collision with another vehicle on Saturday night on the M19 near Reservoir Hills in Durban. ALS Paramedics Medical Services spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said paramedics arrived at the scene just after 11pm to find total carnage. Describing the scene of the crash, Jamieson said it was reported that two vehicles had collided before one vehicle left the road, coming to rest down an embankment. He said a woman in her twenties was found trapped in the wreckage. “She was quickly assessed on the scene, however she had sustained fatal injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for her. She was declared deceased on the scene,” he said. Jamieson said the driver of the vehicle was a man in his twenties. He was also found trapped in the wreckage with critical injuries. According to Jamieson the man was stabilised on the scene by Advanced Life Support Paramedics before being rushed through to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment that he required. “However, he went into a state of cardiac arrest and despite doctors attempts to resuscitate him his injuries were too severe and he was declared deceased at the hospital,” he said. Two patients from the other vehicle sustained moderate to serious injuries, he said. He said the injured patients were stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby Durban hospital. “At this stage the events leading up to the accident are unknown. However, the SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further,” said Jamieson. THE MERCURY
