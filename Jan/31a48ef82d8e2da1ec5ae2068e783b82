Durban - Msunduzi Municipality said three suspects who were allegedly selling proof of residence letters for Msunduzi and eThekwini Municipality were caught red-handed by the Msunduzi law enforcement team outside Mkondeni Testing Centre in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday. Msunduzi Municipality speaker Eunice Majola, who joined the team, said the team had arrived at the centre after receiving a tip-off and put in place an operation. Majola said as part of the operation, a person was sent to purchase a letter and he was able to acquire one for R50. “When we got here we found a number of proof of residence letters from different wards and we also found that there was also proof of residence from eThekwini Municipality in that container[shipping container being used as a business space],” she said. Majola said the municipality had opened a case and the suspects had been taken into custody. Majola added that the municipality would also investigate and interrogate all the councillors who were named on the letters. According to the eThekwini Municipality, municipal councillors are allowed to provide proof of address letters free to residents. Residents who need a letter are required to visit the ward councillor with their ID document and proof that they reside in that particular ward - such as a lease agreement.        THE MERCURY
