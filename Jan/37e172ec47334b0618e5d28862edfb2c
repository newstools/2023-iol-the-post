Durban - The Ugu District Municipality says water supply has been restored to Pennington, Scottburgh South and Central, Park Rynie. In a statement on Saturday updating residents about water supply in Umdoni Municipality, the municipality said there were pockets of areas with low pressure and no water from 4th and 5th streets in Park Rynie.  “Teams will be working on these areas. Please note that the system is still recharging and expect full recovery later today/tomorrow. The pumping process from South Coast pipeline through Ellingham Water Pump Station to Umzinto Water Treatment Works to top up reservoirs storage capacity with treated water for distribution is under way.” The municipality added that at Willowglen Pump Station, two pumps had been running since Friday night but stopping whenever there were Eskom interruptions.  “Currently part of Mahlongwa and Mamdawe that are fed from Willowglen Pump Station have started to get water. Water lines are still filling and the recovery process has started.” It said Nkonka reservoir level was 65%, delayed by Eskom power outages.  The municipality said not all the areas would get water immediately since the system had not fully recovered and because of continuous interruptions from Eskom.  Ugu Municipality added that uMzinto water treatment works was up and running.  “Eskom interruptions remain a major challenge for the system to perform at optimum capacity. Expected load shedding hours today are 9am to 11.30am stage 3 and 5pm to 7.30pm stage 4, this will automatically affect the ability to maintain and run the process effectively.” THE MERCURY
