Internationally-acclaimed artist Nanda Soobben's said the majority are American-related cartoons and some are of Nelson Mandela.  Durban - A Durban cartoonist, Nanda Soobben has given approval for some of his cartoons to feature on clothing, canvas prints and mugs to be sold in New York. Soobben said his cartoons were very popular in the US, especially those of former US president Donald Trump. "I have been doing these cartoons since the Gulf War when George Bush was president. I was recently approached by an online store who requested permission to use my cartoons.  The majority are American-related cartoons and some of Nelson Mandela. They are all timeless pieces, always relevant. "I didn't expect this because I stopped doing cartoons when I got into trouble in South Africa with my work. It's the satire and wit that goes into cartoons,â€œ Soobben was referring to political parties that were offended by his depiction of events in the country.  He said he also previously received awards from the US for his cartoons. Soobben said the items had yet to go on sale. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
