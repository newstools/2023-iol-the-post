Durban - The driver of a BMW was injured when he lost control while on the King Shaka International Airport link road on Saturday night. The driver has not been identified. This comes after a motorist travelling in a BMW on the N2 north-bound near King Shaka International Airport escaped with minor injuries after the impact of a collision with a light pole split the car into two on Thursday. Medi Response spokesperson Paul Herbst said in a statement on Sunday that the Medi Response search and rescue division responded to the King Shaka International Airport link road, after being alerted about reports of a collision. “On arrival on scene it was established that a single vehicle had lost control and left the roadway, travelled off of a bridge and came to rest in a body of water,” he said. He said paramedics assessed the scene and found that the single occupant of the vehicle had sustained moderate injuries. “He was treated on scene by Medi Response before being transported to hospital for further care,” Herbst said.   In a separate accident on Saturday, IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick reported that two vehicles collided on the N2 near Tugela. He said three people sustained injuries ranging from serious to moderate and were stabilised on scene by IPSS Medical Rescue Advanced Life Support paramedics before being taken to hospital.
