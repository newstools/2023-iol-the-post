Durban — A baby boy who was abandoned opposite a police station in Phoenix was rescued after his screams were heard by a resident on Monday morning. KZN VIP spokesperson Gareth Naidoo said that the newborn baby was found abandoned in the blistering heat opposite the Phoenix police station. Naidoo said that at 9.22am a call came for assistance in Brayford Avenue where the screams of a newborn were heard by Farouk Bobat. “Bobat was fast acting together with his community members, who rallied together and discovered a newborn abandoned male by a fence opposite the Phoenix Highway across his home. KZN VIP were also called in to assist,” Naidoo said. “The baby is now safe and in the care of KZN VIP medics, who responded to the call together with SAPS. The baby has been treated and transported to the hospital for further medical attention at a medical facility.” Naidoo said well done to Bobat and all key role-players. Police have been approached for comment. Reacting to the incident on Facebook, Adele Pandy said there was no excuse to dump a baby knowing its life is at risk. The mother should be found and charged and the father also. Both had this child and both are responsible for its care, Pandy said. Anisha Ravichand said: “Beyond sick, there are places where you can hand over babies. Thank you to the people who rescued this baby.” Wendy Singh said: “How cruel… carry the baby for nine months only to abandon the baby. So many women out there would give anything to have the blessing of being a mother.” Marriam Nakhooda said: “These mothers are just sick. She could’ve left the baby at a hospital… poor angel…” Daily News
