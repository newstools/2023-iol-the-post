The motive for the killing is unknown and no arrest has been made at this stage.” According to an incident report, a female police officer was also in the home at the time of the shooting.  She told police that a man entered the home through a toilet window and pointed a firearm at her, instructing her to keep quiet.  The woman said she was taken to another room and then she heard several gunshots go off.  Mhlongo said investigations were ongoing.
