Durban - The South African Police Service (SAPS) has issued a warning against members of the public wearing and using SAPS property. SAPS national spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said the warning comes after a civilian was seen in a video clip wearing a SAPS cap and also seated in the driver's seat in what appeared to be a SAPS vehicle. Mathe said actions are in contravention of the SAPS act. “The South African Police Service (SAPS) is warning members of the public against the unauthorised and illegal use of SAPS property which include uniforms, equipment and emblems. This comes as police have noted a video clip circulating on social media platforms, in which a civilian can be seen in a marked police vehicle wearing an SAPS cap. “This unauthorised use of SAPS property and uniform is in direct contravention of the SAPS Act. To this end, this civilian has committed at least three offences in terms of the SAPS Act; Section 66 (1), 68(1) and 68(3) in that he wore the emblems and official insignia of the SAPS,” said Mathe. Mathe said members of the public should take heed that such offences would result in a criminal record upon conviction, She added that the video clip incident was under investigation. “The man has thus created a false impression that he is lawfully associated with the police service by being in a marked police vehicle and wearing the badge and emblem of the SAPS which is protected by law.” THE MERCURY
