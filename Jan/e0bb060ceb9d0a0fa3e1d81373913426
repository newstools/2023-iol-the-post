Durban - An accident on Sani Pass Road in KwaZulu-Natal has resulted in the tragic death of the driver of a bakkie while four others were injured on Monday. Underberg Emergency Medical Services (UEMS) base manager Kate Bodmann said that at 1:15pm, the base was contacted for a crash along the Sani Pass Road, just before the start of the switchbacks. However, she said due to the condition of the road and a downpour, UEMS ambulances waited at the Sani Pass border post. “The UEMS 4x4 Response vehicle, which is converted to carry supine patients, was mobilised,” said Bodmann. Bodmann said upon arrival, paramedics found a single vehicle crash. She said four occupants of the vehicle sustained minor to moderate injuries and were shuttled down the pass in the response vehicle to awaiting ambulances. The patients were then transported to a nearby hospital for further medical attention, she said. “Unfortunately the driver of the vehicle had succumbed to injuries before the arrival of emergency services,” said Bodmann. Bodmann added that all necessary services were on the scene and the incident will be investigated accordingly. In a separate accident on New Year’s eve, IPSS Medical Rescue reported that an accident involving two minibus taxis on Watson Highway in oThongathi resulted in 16 people sustaining injuries ranging from minor to serious. “Patients were stabilised on scene before being transported to various facilities for further care,”said IPSS spokesperson Dylan Meyrick.
