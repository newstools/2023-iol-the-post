Durban - Msunduzi Municipality announced on Wednesday that Alexandra swimming pool in Pietermaritzburg had been closed. This comes after a man drowned at the pool on Tuesday. “Please note the Alexandra swimming pool is currently closed to the public following the incident that took place (on Tuesday), in which someone drowned,” said the municipality. The swimming pool would remain closed until investigations by the SAPS were concluded, the municipality said. Provincial police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Alexandra Road police were investigating an inquest after a man drowned at Alexandra swimming pool. “He was found floating in the pool on 10 January 2023,” she said. The municipality said members of the public were advised to use the Buchanan Street and Berg Street swimming pools, which are in the CBD. In a separate incident last week, Medi Response successfully resuscitated a young boy who had got into difficulty in a pool in an estate on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast. According to Medi Response spokesperson Paul Herbst, when paramedics arrived at the estate it was established that a young boy, who was unresponsive, had been pulled from the water and CPR was initiated by a bystander. “Medi Response paramedics joined the resuscitation effort and, following a full advanced life support resus, crews managed to regain circulation and a pulse,” he said. The child was transported to hospital in a critical condition, he said. THE MERCURY
