Durban - Armed robbers stole an undisclosed amount of cash from the Mayville post office on Tuesday, which was a scheduled Sassa grant collection day for pensioners. SA Post Office (Sapo) spokesperson Johan Kruger said at about 8.55am on January 3, the branch manager at Mayville post office was in her office when she heard a loud bang. Kruger said the manager walked to the front to see what was happening. “She saw a man smashing the front counter glass window and pointing a firearm at her,” he said. He said the man then jumped over the counter. “The suspect forced the branch manager at gunpoint to hand over the cash on hand,” said Kruger. SAPS attended the scene and fingerprints were lifted, he said, adding that the getaway vehicle was a white Corolla. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said Mayville police were investigating a case of robbery. “It is alleged that three armed suspects accosted employees and took an undisclosed amount of cash,” she said. Gwala added that no shots were fired and no injuries were reported. Sassa KZN spokesperson Sandy Godlwana confirmed that the robbery took place just as the money arrived for beneficiary payments. She said there were six beneficiaries awaiting payment at the time. Godlwana said as a result of the robbery no payment could take place as the post office became a crime scene under the custody of the SAPS. She said awaiting beneficiaries were advised to go to the nearest banks and merchant stores to receive their grants. She added that no payments were taking place today at the Mayville post office. “No payments are taking place today (Wednesday) as staff are traumatised and undergoing counselling,” said Godlwana.
