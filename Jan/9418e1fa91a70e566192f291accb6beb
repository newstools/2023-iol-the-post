Durban - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has condemned the attempted murder of Eskom CEO André de Ruyter. Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam, leader of the NFP in Parliament said that the party also condemns the use of intimidation and sabotage tactics to make South Africa ungovernable through Eskom. “If it is true that De Ruyter was poisoned, then we need to get to the bottom of who wanted to silence him. This is not a banana republic. We are governed by rules and laws, and if we are unhappy with someone’s performance at an SOE, then we need to follow the correct procedures,” he said. Emam added that the NFP takes what De Ruyter said about the incident very seriously. “This is why an urgent investigation is needed, as poisoning of this kind would imply both proximity and opportunity. “Furthermore, while we are glad the police are investigating this matter, we call for a broader investigation into a plot to make South Africa ungovernable through Eskom,” he said. Emam said that there were constant reports of sabotage at Eskom. “We need a broader investigation to see if these things are connected. Right now, our economy is in shambles because load shedding continues to disrupt workflow. We need to know if this was part of a malicious coordinated plan,” he said. Emam added that further to this, the NFP is deeply concerned about the recent attempt on the life of Fort Hare vice-chancellor Professor Sakhela Buhlungu, and the murder of Mboneli Vesele, his bodyguard. “We extend our condolences to the friends and family of Mr Vesele. This was a senseless murder, by people who have lost their moral compass. This is a targeting of people with integrity and who want to root out corruption. This is exactly what happened to whistle-blower, Babita Deokaran. There is lawlessness in this country that is deeply problematic, and it is apparent that our intelligence agencies are lagging behind,” he said. THE MERCURY
