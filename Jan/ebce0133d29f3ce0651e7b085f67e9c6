Durban - The eThekwini Municipality said that mobile clinics were not able to access communities in ward 2 due to a flooded bridge in the area. In a post on its Facebook page, the municipality said clinical health services were disrupted on Wednesday and would also not be available on Thursday. “EThekwini Municipality’s health unit would like to inform community members residing in ward 2, west of Durban, of an interruption to clinical health services between today, January 4, and tomorrow, January 5. Mobile clinics were unable to cross a flooded bridge this morning to render health-care services to the community,” the post read. Mkhizwane was one of the affected areas in ward 2. The municipality added that services would resume as soon as the water subsided. “Affected areas include Mqeku, Mkhizwane, KwaNqethu, Matata, and surrounding areas. The unit apologises to the affected communities for the inconvenience caused. Services will resume as soon as the water subsides,” said the post. Ward 2 councillor Wilfred Luthuli said the services would resume once the clinics were able to access the affected areas. “These bridges are low lying so when we have rain, even if it’s not heavy, they just become flooded. But we are working on fixing this with the municipality, it cannot keep on delaying service delivery,” Luthuli said. THE MERCURY Now watch:  The 2022 Floods in KZN
