Durban — Two suspects, among them a teenager, are expected back in court in a few days after they allegedly hijacked and stabbed their friend to death. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Lindani Mbatha, 19, and Nzukwiswa Giwose, 25, appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, January 12, for the alleged car-jacking and murder of their friend Wandamusa Koza, 27. “The pair were remanded in custody and will be back in the dock on January 20 when they are expected to make a formal bid for bail,” Ngcobo said. “Koza’s body was found with multiple stab wounds in a sports ground at G section in KwaMashu. The deceased had already been reported missing after he reportedly left home on December 31, 2022, and never returned.” Ngcobo said an intensive investigation led the police to Glendale near the Maphumulo area where his vehicle was recovered. “Further investigations resulted in the arrest of Mbatha on Tuesday, January 10, 2023. His friend Giwose was arrested a day later at a traditional healer’s residence in Siyanda,” Ngcobo said. “Police also recovered a dagger knife which was suspected to have been used in the commission of the crime as well as the deceased’s cellphone.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday, IOL reported that a police constable stationed at the Bishopstowe SAPS in KwaZulu-Natal was expected to appear in the Pomeroy Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for allegedly killing his friend and fiancée. Independent Police Investigative Directorate national spokesperson Lizzy Suping said the officer allegedly killed his friend on Friday and two days later he allegedly murdered his fiancée in Msinga. Suping said both bodies were dumped in nearby bushes. The post-mortem on the bodies was conducted on January 10. The suspected officer handed himself over to the police on Monday. “The Ipid investigation is under way,” Suping said. Daily News
