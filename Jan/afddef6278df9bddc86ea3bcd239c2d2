Durban — Angry Mayville residents have had to embark on a street protest – burning tyres and blocking traffic – on Saturday evening because of ongoing power cuts that have left the area in total darkness since last Thursday. The cause of the problem is unknown, and has led to some residents having had to throw away some of their food because it is rotting. The fed-up ratepayers say they have not heard anything from eThekwini Municipality since the problem began. Resident Yongama Nonkula said the whole of Mayville had been left in darkness since last week, and to make matters worse they had not heard from the municipality at all. “The problem was reported as soon as the power got cut, but no one has come to fix it,” Nonkula said. The residents suspect a transformer might have tripped, throwing the whole area into total darkness.  “Our lives have been thrown into disarray. We have had to throw away some food because it is going rotten, as our fridges are off. Paraffin and candles are not only expensive, but also dangerous, because they can result in houses burning down.” Attempts to obtain comment from eThekwini Municipality on the electricity problem were unsuccessful at the time of publication.
