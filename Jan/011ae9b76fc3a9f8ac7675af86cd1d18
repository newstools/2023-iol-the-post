Durban — Police arrested nine suspects in two separate robbery-related incidents on Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, police in Durban Central foiled a planned armed robbery and arrested four suspects at the corner of Anton Lembede and Gardener streets in the Durban central business district. Police said officers were on their routine patrol duties when they spotted a vehicle with four occupants parked on the side of the road. The officers approached the vehicle. “Upon searching the vehicle, the suspects were found in illegal possession of two firearms and 18 live rounds of ammunition,” police said.  “Preliminary police investigations uncovered that the four were planning to rob a customer who was to deposit a large amount of money.” Also on Tuesday, one suspect was killed and five of his accomplices landed in hospital after they crashed while evading arrest following a house robbery incident in Durban. Police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said that the Umbilo Task Team were patrolling along Fielden Drive in Umbilo when they spotted a vehicle with six occupants. The vehicle was positively identified as one which was reported to have been involved in a house robbery in the Malvern area earlier in the day. With the suspects defying the police’s instruction to stop, a high speed chase ensued.  “The suspects drove into the oncoming traffic on Umbilo Road and collided head-on with a horse and trailer. The driver of the suspects’ vehicle succumbed to his injuries at the scene and the other five suspects were arrested and taken to hospital. “The suspects were found in possession of three firearms and 19 rounds of ammunition. Two of the firearms were positively linked with house robbery cases in Malvern and Pinetown which they allegedly committed in December,” Netshiunda said. He said the five suspects, aged between 20 and 27, will appear in court soon. Daily News
