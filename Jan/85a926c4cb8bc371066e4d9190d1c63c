Durban - Bagging 8 distinctions is no small feat, especially for Naldon Ramlakan of Crawford International North Coast who faced enormous challenges. The 18-year-old from Shakaskraal attained 8 As.  “My matric year was not easy. Last February my beloved grandmother passed away. The memories of her motivating me kept me going. “My family is not wealthy. I am only able to attend Crawford under a scholarship. During the floods last year, our small shop in Shakaskraal was flooded. “Our home was also flooded and many of my books damaged. Thankfully, I had amazing teachers and peers who helped me. I am on the Autistic spectrum and have attention difficulties. “I am torn between studying actuarial science at Stellenbosch and medicine at UCT. I believe I will end up studying actuarial science based purely on my love of mathematics. I’m awaiting final acceptance. My family has always motivated me. The all-nighters and sleepless days have all been worth it. It makes me proud to my family proud.” Staesha Sankar, 18, attained 7As. “It’s exhilarating and exciting to see that my hard work has paid off,” said Staesha, who attends the same school. “To achieve success, I minimised my sleep schedule and social outings. “I want to study computer science. I have applied to UCT, UKZN, Wits and Stellenbosch University. I’ve been provisionally accepted to all but I have not yet decided which university I will attend.” Suyashan Valaitham, 18, from Westbrook, had 7 As. He said: “I faced immense pressure. I was always reminded that my future is in my own hands. “But despite it all, I always tried to balance my life by distressing with sports or spending time with my family. “I want to study actuarial science. I have also applied for medicine. I am leaning toward studying actuarial science at UCT. Numbers have always been my strong point.” The Post
