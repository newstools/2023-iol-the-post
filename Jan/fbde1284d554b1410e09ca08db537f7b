Durban - The much-loved Ster-Kinekor Musgrave cinema is permanently closing down on Thursday. A national representative of Ster-Kinekor, who did not want to be named, confirmed the closure. “Musgrave Ster-Kinekor is indeed closing down,” said the representative. The representative said that cinemas were closed due to poor financial performance, adding that the staff working at those cinemas would be transferred to other Ster-Kinekor branches. Musgrave Centre confirmed the closure in a statement and said retailer Checkers would replace the cinema. “The existing Ster-Kinekor premises, situated on Level 4, will be reconfigured to accommodate Checkers. The multi-million-rand project will take approximately ten to twelve months to complete, commencing in quarter 1 of 2023. The new store offering will strengthen the Centre’s tenant mix and make it the ideal location for convenience offering.” The centre said while many customers have great memories from the cinema and it will be missed, the decision is based on an adapting business plan that has received positive feedback. A representative from Musgrave Ster-Kinekor said the final movies will be aired on Thursday. “We are closing permanently. On Thursday night all our loyal fans are coming for the last movie, we will watch together,” he said. Nadia Meer, a regular Ster-Kinekor Musgrave cinema customer, said she had been saddened by the news of the closure. “It is a terrible loss to the entire Durban central area. So many people are sad. When the Musgrave movie club heard about this, everyone was very upset,” said Meer. THE MERCURY
