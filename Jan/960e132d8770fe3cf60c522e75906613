Durban — The South African Employment and Labour Department issued a request and warning to employers to ensure that they submit their annual 2022 employment equity reports timeously. In his report, Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi said employers should ensure that they beat the clock as the January 15 deadline approached. The EE reporting season for both manual and online submission opened on September 1, 2022, and for manual reporting the closing date was October 1, 2022. Nxesi said the relevant forms to submit were obtainable from the department website at www.labour.gov.za. “The purpose of the EEA is to promote equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment through the elimination of unfair discrimination, implementing affirmative action measures to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups and to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational levels in the workforce,” Nxesi said.  Failure to abide with the provisions of the EE Act may result in imposition of fines. “This year’s submission of EE report plans coincides with the year in which the amended EE legislation is expected to take effect once the amended EE Bill has been signed into law.. “The main objectives of the amendments are to empower the employment and labour minister to regulate sector-specific EE targets and to regulate compliance criteria to issue EE Compliance Certificate in terms of Section 53 of the EE Act. “This means that organisations especially those that do business with the government will have to be in good standing when it comes to compliance with EE,” Nxesi said.
