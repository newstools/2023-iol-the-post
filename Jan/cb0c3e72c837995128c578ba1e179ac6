Durban - The ANC has slammed the planned motion of no confidence to be tabled against eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda, saying the action reeked of desperation. The motion was filed yesterday on an urgent basis and is expected to be debated at the January 31 council meeting. It was put forward by the Active Citizens Coalition (ACC) party. The motion, addressed to the office of the Speaker, Thabani Nyawose, read: “Please receive this urgent notice of motion to remove councillor Mxolisi Kaunda as a member of executive committee (exco) of eThekwini Municipality.” Kaunda said he was not in a position to speak on the issue yesterday, while his office said it could engage on the matter today. ANC councillor and exco member Nkosenhle Madlala said the party viewed the motion as an act of desperation.  “We believe that it is an act of revenge against the ANC for the removal of councillor Mavundla (former deputy mayor Philani Mavundla) from the position of deputy mayor,” he said. He also described it as an attempt to destabilise the municipality. He said the party would oppose the motion. DA councillor Thabani Mthethwa said: “The DA caucus in eThekwini has not taken a decision on the issue. If it is indeed tabled, the caucus will discuss it and consult the DA leadership.” Mavundla said in a statement that his party supported the motion. “The notice of motion to remove the mayor comes after a period that has been characterised by uncertainty and confusion among the people of eThekwini, following my removal as the deputy mayor and chairperson of the human settlements and infrastructure cluster,” he said. He said that as deputy mayor he had identified many problems that had a direct impact on service delivery, and had unsuccessfully tried to bring the city’s attention to them. “We hope that other political parties who care about the people will vote in favour of the motion to remove the mayor,” he said.
