Durban - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has applauded members of the community who helped bring alleged burglars to justice after they broke into the  Cape Town office of humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers and stole several items. In a statement on Wednesday, NFP leader in Parliament, Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam, said the crime levels are “ridiculous” in South Africa. He said a few weeks ago, a mosque was broken into, and now an NGO had been targeted. “The NFP applauds the sterling work of the community to help bring to justice the criminals who stole and damaged the property of Gift of the Givers, a non-profit organisation which does exceptional work inside and outside South Africa,” he said. In an interview with eNCA after the burglary on Monday, Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman said when staff arrived at the office, the front door was open and items collected for Cape Town fire victims were scattered about, while the TV, laptops, desktop computers, microwave and Covid-19 PPE, awards and gifts received were among the items missing. He said the SAPS arrived within minutes, as did neighbours from nearby areas. “People began sending out messages, and within a few hours 11 suspects were arrested and a number of the items were found,” said Sooliman. Sooliman said this shows what can be achieved when you have the support of the community. “The community themselves found the people and the SAPS arrested them.” He added that CCTV footage from next door had picked up that a white Quantum had arrived and seven people jumped out. “The all-round co-operation, the speed and efficiency of the SAPS with the support of the community, it was just great that something was done so quickly,” said Sooliman. He said the organisation is thankful to the community, who had also assisted after a staff member was shot in Andover Park four years ago. “We are extremely thankful to you for what you have done in this instance and many other instances. You know who the criminals are in your area. It could be your son, brother, father, uncle. You have a responsibility to expose that and pass the information on to the SAPS because we need to clean our society.  “You need to change that, because the same people could be responsible for promoting drugs, involved with killing and it could be your own family members that in the long run may suffer,” he said. The Mercury’s sister publication, the Cape Argus reported that another suspect had been arrested, bringing the total number of arrests to 12.
