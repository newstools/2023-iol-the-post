Durban - The food that you consume and underlying diseases has an effect on how your mouth smells.  This is according to Dr Nokwanda Dlamini who said oral hygiene was one of the key things into having a healthy and free smelling mouth. She said it was crucial to not have too much of anything. Dr Dlamini said food that consists of sugar like sweets and cakes is not good for your mouth. “Food that has a lot of acid is not good for your mouth or your teeth. I know people like to detox with vinegar and water with lemon. This is also not good. The acid makes the outer coverage of the teeth called enamel erode. If you are drinking lemon water it’s better to use a straw,” she advised. Moreover she said it was imperative that one rinses their mouth in between meals or during the day, as this helps to remove food stuck in your teeth. She said food that has lasted longer in your mouth causes acid which contributes to rotten teeth and that leads to having a stinky breath. Adding to other contributors to smelly mouth she said the lack of saliva (Xerostomia) is also a contributing factor. “Saliva’s function is to flush germs, food and maintain your mouth to be clean,” said Dr Dlamini. Moreover she said having a stinky mouth can also stem from certain diseases that one has. She said if you have sinuses, diabetes and someone who has stomach diseases your mouth can tell a story. Dr Dlamini said if you have these diseases your mouth can stink but to solve the problem one can start by treating and controlling them. Daily News
