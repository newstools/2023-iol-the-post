The pair were caught parked near the Solomon Mahlangu (Edwin Swales) Drive turn-off at the N2 where they were allegedly dumping sewage from a mobile unit. According to The Mercury, Ms Hygiene management denied wrongdoing. The mobile toilet company’s management claimed that the trailer was in transit from uMnini where it occasionally parked to get prepared for a booking the following day. The management said that during the drive, one of the doors opened and a yellow pipe fell out, forcing the driver to stop and put it back into the trailer.   “An unidentified man came with a camera, claiming staff were involved in desludging of the stormwater drainage. This door had been repaired recently and to the best of the knowledge of our personnel, it had been fixed,” they told the publication. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the city was aware of the video and the matter was being investigated internally.
