The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) said the new DA councillor is Renisha Singh, in ward 28, and said the party retained the seat won in the 2021 municipal elections, with 59,70% of the total votes cast compared to 62,03% during the 2021 municipal elections and voter turnout was 33.93%. The new IFP councillor in ward 9 in Mtubatuba is Joy Bukiswa Mthiyane. The IEC said the IFP won the seat previously won by the ANC in the 2021 municipal elections, with 77,22% of the total votes cast. The voter turnout was 42,40%. IFP national spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the party thanked the people of Mtubatuba for their overwhelming support. “As the IFP, we are elated with the by-election results, as they will enable the IFP to govern Mtubatuba better. We also remain committed to the principle of servant leadership and service delivery. Further, these results indicate a clear trajectory of consistent growth for the IFP across KwaZulu-Natal, and that the IFP is in a stronger position for the 2024 elections,” said Hlengwa. DA KZN leader Francois Rodgers said the party is pleased to have retained Ward 28 in Msunduzi, in a by-election. “The DA thanks all voters who turned out in their numbers in the ward 28 by-elections. Voters in Msunduzi and the province are showing their dissatisfaction with the ANC in the polls, where it matters. Msunduzi can only work under a DA government. As we have proven in uMngeni, the DA ensures that the needs of voters are placed ahead of those of the party,” said Rodgers. THE MERCURY
