Durban — Tongaat police are investigating a case of murder after a man was shot dead on the N2 on Monday afternoon. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said: “Tongaat is investigating a case of murder after a 42-year-old man was allegedly shot and killed on the N2 Toll Road between Ballito and Crocodile Creek Bridge on Monday, January 9, 2023.” She added that police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. On Tuesday morning, IOL reported that according to information Raymond Naguru, 48, had been travelling from Ballito in a Toyota panel Quantum carrying medical supplies. It is alleged Naguru had two employees with him, and on the way gave the two men a lift. They had told Naguru that they were on their way to the airport. About 50m into the drive, one of the suspects who was seated at the back, pulled out a firearm and screamed for all to get down. It is alleged that the driver continued to drive and shots were fired and Naguru was hit. The driver is alleged to have stopped the vehicle and to have fallen out of his seat. The suspects then ran into nearby sugar cane fields. On Monday afternoon, IPSS Medical Rescue managing director Dylan Meyrick said they responded to a scene on the N2 southbound just before the Tongaat toll-gate. “Reports from witnesses indicate that three people were shot after stopping to pick up hitchhikers on the N2. One person was declared dead on the scene. Two patients sustained numerous gunshot wounds and were on the scene stabilised by IPSS Medical advanced life-support,” Meyrick said. “The suspects fled the crime scene,” he said. Meyrick said the area was an active crime scene and he urged motorists to travel with caution. Daily News
