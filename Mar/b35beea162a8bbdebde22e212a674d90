Durban - The body of a man believed to be in his thirties was discovered by a fisherman at the side of a river in the Hazelmere area near Verulam on Monday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the body of a semi-naked man was discovered dumped in overgrown grass next to a river by a fisherman on Monday afternoon. Balram said a member of the Community Policing Forum (CPF) contacted Rusa just after 3pm. He said Rusa was contacted after a fisherman discovered the body. “On arrival, Reaction Officers with police officials from the Verulam SAPS were led approximately 100 metres from the road to the scene,” said Balram.

Rigor mortis (stiffening of the body muscles) was present and the body sustained multiple abrasions and scaring consistent with assault,” said Balram.
