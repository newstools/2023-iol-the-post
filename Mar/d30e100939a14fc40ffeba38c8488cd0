Kyle van Reenen of Emer-G-Med said multiple emergency services agencies rushed to the scene on the M41 onramp to the M4 highway just before 8am. He said the latest count showed 47 vehicles were involved.  On arrival at the scene, teams were met with absolute mayhem as reports indicate that a fully laden truck ploughed into multiple light motor vehicles. At this point it is unconfirmed what substance the truck was hauling. The Ethekwini Fire Department have secured the scene until confirmation is made that it is safe,“ van Reenen said. “Reports from the scene are that multiple people have been left with injuries ranging from minor to serious. A pregnant woman was airlifted, with the assistance of the Netcare911 aeromedical helicopter through to a specialist facility for the definitive care that she requires,” he said.
