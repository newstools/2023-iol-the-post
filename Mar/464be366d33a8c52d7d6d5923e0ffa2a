When emergency teams arrived they found mayhem, he said. According to reports, a fully laden truck ploughed into multiple vehicles. The nature of the truck’s cargo has not yet been confirmed.  “The eThekwini Fire Department has secured the scene until confirmation is made that it is safe,” Van Reenen said Speaking to the SABC, eThekwini metro police spokesperson Boysie Zungu said the truck driver fled.     “According to information I have received, the driver of the truck is nowhere to be found. He fled the scene. That on its own is a crime,” Zungu said.    He added while the matter was under investigation, brake failure was believed to have been the cause of the crash.  IOL
