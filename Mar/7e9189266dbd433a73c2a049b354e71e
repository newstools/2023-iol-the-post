Durban – Two people died on Sunday morning after the vehicle they were travelling in plunged 40m down an embankment and into a river in KwaDukuza, formerly known as Stanger. According to IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick, at around 5am the members from IPSS Search and Rescue members assisted SAPS Search and Rescue with an accident in the KwaDukuza area. “On arrival it was established that the vehicle had lost control and gone down a 40m embankment into the river,” he said.   Meyrick said search and rescue members made their way down the embankment to the vehicle. He said the members entered the water and recovered one of the occupants, while the second occupant, the driver of the vehicle, was trapped in the vehicle and had to be extricated from the wreckage.
