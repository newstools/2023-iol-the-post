Durban — No arrests were made in a lodge when police recovered drugs worth R1.5 million in Durban. Police Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said that officers from the Provincial Drug and Firearm Unit acted on information about drugs that were stored in an unused geyser room on Wednesday, February 1, 2023. Gwala said that the information led the team to a lodge on Dr Pixley Ka Seme Street in the Durban central business district where a raid was executed. “A thorough search was conducted and police recovered various drugs such as methcathinone, capsules of mandrax, heroin powder, crystal meth, rock cocaine and other drugs. No one was found inside. The estimated street value of the recovered drugs is approximately R1.5m,” Gwala said. Meanwhile, a few days before this recovery, two foreign nationals and a local woman were arrested with R500 000 worth of drugs, also at a lodge. Police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said that two foreign nationals aged 32 and 46 years old  and a 25-year-old local woman were arrested after they were found to be running a mini-drug lab on the premises of a lodge at Point, in Durban on Thursday, January 26, 2023. Netshiunda said that Provincial Drugs and Firearms Unit officers conducted a sting operation which was backed up by intelligence information and stormed the  lodge where three suspects were found to have turned a guest room into a clandestine drug lab. “Almost 12 000 capsules of heroin, 600g of heroin powder and 37 pieces of rock cocaine, with an estimated street value of approximately R500 000 were found in possession of the suspects,” Netshiunda said.
