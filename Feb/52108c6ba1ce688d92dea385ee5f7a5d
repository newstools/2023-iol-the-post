Durban – Backlogged traffic has been cleared on Umgeni Road near the Thekwini TVET College after approximately 50 students blocked the busy roadway with burning tyres on Wednesday morning. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said it was reported that around 50 students staged a protest on Umgeni Road. He said the protest caused a delay in traffic. “Police managed to quell the protest and the traffic has been cleared,” said Netshiunda. It has not yet been established what sparked the protest action by the students. Tertiary institutions are currently busy with registration for the academic year. Messages were circulated on social media and traffic alert groups, warning motorists to avoid the area which usually has high traffic volumes. There are several large stores and shopping centres in the vicinity.    Marshall Security, as well as police and metro police, were at the scene. In a video shared by Marshall Security, traffic is seen flowing freely. On Monday in an unrelated incident, “The Mercury” reported that parents and School Governing Body (SGB) members protested outside Siyathuthuka Secondary School in Newton A in Inanda against the shortage of teachers at the school. The school has more than 600 pupils with just seven teachers. The parents and pupils said the situation was hindering teaching and learning and they wanted the matter attended to. THE MERCURY
