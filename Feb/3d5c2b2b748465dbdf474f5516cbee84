Durban — KZN Cycling has emphasised rider safety, this after recent reports of tragic cyclist road deaths and injuries. The emphasis comes after the death of Veven Naidoo who was hit by a vehicle on the M4 near Sibaya on Saturday. Naidoo, 46, had been a member of the East Coast Cycling Club since 2014. In Gauteng, a cyclist partaking in a race was struck down by a motorist on Sunday morning. He had to be stabilised and then flown by Netcare helicopter to a specialised trauma unit. Angus McFarlane of KZN Cycling said that it has received notification of a number of rider safety-related complaints related to multiple riders riding abreast, riding down the wrong way of roads, riders’ lack of courtesy, riders obstructing road traffic and riders ignoring stop signs and lights. “This is disturbing in light of recent tragic cyclist road deaths and injuries,” McFarlane said. “We have to play an active role in ensuring our own safety by ensuring that we ride in a safe manner. Safety on our roads requires a high degree of respect and tolerance demonstrated by all road users. Flipping a finger and shouting at a motorist doesn’t help our cause, regardless of the circumstances. Riding in such a way that causes traffic congestion and motorist frustration also doesn’t help our cause,” he said. McFarlane also reminded cyclists that cycling on the M4 between the Umgeni River and uMhlanga is prohibited. This measure is in place to protect your safety. Cyclists caught on this section of the road has implications for their club. “We are asking that all cycling clubs treat this matter seriously and urgently share this message with their riders,” McFarlane said.
