Durban - A hijacking in the Eastwood area of Pietermaritzburg last week resulted in the death of two victims and a crash on the N3 highway. Security company, Magma Security & Investigations owner Shaheen Suleiman said on Thursday, February 2, there was a report of an incident in the Eastwood area where two victims were shot dead and the vehicle was taken. On the same day, the vehicle that was taken, a black Audi A3, was then spotted travelling along the N3.  “As (the perpetrators) attempted to flee the area, they fired shots at the other motorists, to clear their path of escape,” said Suleiman. Suleiman said after the stolen vehicle crashed into a truck on the N3, the two suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot into a nearby farm in the Bellevue area. He said Magma members and police conducted a search for them and one suspect was arrested. He added that two 9mm pistols were also recovered. “The suspect was taken to Mountain Rise SAPS where he was detained,” said Suleiman. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said Mountain Rise police are investigating two counts of murder and hijacking. “One person was declared dead at the scene while the second one succumbed to gunshot injuries in hospital,” he said. Netshiunda said the vehicle was later found abandoned on the N3 south bound just after Mkondeni. “Mountain Rise police arrested a 29-year-old suspect on the same day of the incident at a farm in Pietermaritzburg. He was found in possession of two unlicensed firearms and ammunition and is set to appear today in Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court,” he said. THE MERCURY
