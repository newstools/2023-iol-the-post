The handover will be presided over by the MEC for Social Development in KwaZulu-Natal, Nonhlanhla Khoza.  The department said the two foundations were embarking on a #BackToSchool programme where 460 pairs of school shoes will be distributed to pupils from 10 different schools.  The foundations announced the return of the “Back to School” campaign with a R4 million pledge to assist parents and pupils from various communities across South Africa.

On (February) 16 we are going to other schools along with our brand ambassador, cricketer Keshav Maharaj,” said Ngobese. Ngobese said the foundation, which also runs a bursary programme for needy schools,  deals with community issues.
