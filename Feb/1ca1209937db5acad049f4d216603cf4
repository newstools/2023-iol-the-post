Durban -The National Freedom Party (NFP) has expressed its gratitude to David Mabuza, for his service after he confirmed that he had resigned as deputy president of the country.  IOL reported on Saturday that Mabuza, addressing mourners at his brother’s funeral in Mpumalanga on Saturday, confirmed he had sent a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa saying he was resigning. Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam, leader of the NFP in Parliament, said the party acknowledged the resignation of Mabuza and expressed its gratitude for his service to the country.  Shaik Emam said the NFP was encouraged by the possibility of Paul Mashatile, who was elected ANC deputy president in December, taking on the role of deputy president.  “We hope that his appointment will bring new energy and ideas to the Presidency.” Shaik Emam added that the NFP looked forward to working with Mashatile, as leader of government business in Parliament, should he be appointed as deputy president of South Africa.  “However, while we welcome his appointment, our support extends only so far as his willingness to fight corruption and put the people of South Africa first.” Shaik Emam said having worked with Mashatlie before, he could attest to the fact that he is very committed and knowledgeable.  “We believe he will contribute to facilitating greater ease and a better working relationship between the executive and legislative branches.” Shaik Emam added that the NFP remained deeply concerned about the major challenges facing South Africa, including increasing unemployment, widespread poverty and service delivery failures at every level of government.  “We will continue in our mandate, to hold the executive accountable, while working to foster a stronger and more united South Africa.” THE MERCURY
