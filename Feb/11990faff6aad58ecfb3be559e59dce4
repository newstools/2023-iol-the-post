Durban – Westville Senior Primary School in Durban is 'winning at twinning' with 12 sets of twins attending the school. The proud primary school has the highest number of twins at the school to date. Celebrating the unusual achievement, the school posted a picture of most of the twins on its Facebook page last week. “No, you’re not seeing double, we’re just winning at twinning over here at Westville Senior Primary! Even with one twin missing, take a look at the double trouble that’s twice as nice! And even though they’re twins, they really are one of a kind and we’re lucky to have joy made double by these twins,” wrote the school. Speaking to ‘The Mercury’ on Thursday, the school said not only are there 12 sets of twins attending the school but there are also two sets of twins on the teaching staff. This brings the total number of sets to 14. The school said there is “tremendous” confusion when twins are in the same class. ”Our receptionist gets utterly confused with teachers and there's always a mischievous giggle when she mixes them up. It's truly difficult to tell them apart but in a fun way.” The school said twins are not always placed in the same class. “Some parents request for their twins to be kept together whilst others prefer them to be in separate classes.” The school said it was “great” to have such a large number of twins attending the school. “Watching the dynamics between them is interesting and worth a study on its own. Teachers are clever people – some of them can see the differences immediately, so there's no fooling them.” THE MERCURY
