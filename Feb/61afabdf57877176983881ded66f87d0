Durban - Just days before President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday, the National Freedom Party (NFP) has called on the acting Public Protector, advocate Kholeka Gcaleka, to release the Phala Phala farm scandal report. The NFP’s Canaan Mdletshe said that last month, Gcaleka's office announced that it had concluded its investigations and that the draft report was going through its internal review structures for quality assurances. The party was therefore calling on Gcaleka to release the report before Ramaphosa took to the podium on Thursday night. “The reality is that President Ramaphosa must not deliver Sona this week because he has disregarded and infringed on the country's Constitution. President Ramaphosa must be stopped from addressing the nation, and rather, he must leave the office as a matter of urgency. We cannot have a president who abuses his powers and authority by totally ignoring the laws of the country,” Mdletshe said. He said MPs should not allow Ramaphosa to address them. “We urge them to disrupt his speech at any given opportunity. The time for our parliamentarians to take a stand is now. They must demonstrate that they are on the side of the people,” he said. THE MERCURY
