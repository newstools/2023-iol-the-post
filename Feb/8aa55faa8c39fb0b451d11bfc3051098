Durban – Teams from humanitarian aid organisation Gift of the Givers and Medi Response arrived in Türkiye on Wednesday to assist victims in Türkiye and Syria following the devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake that has left thousands dead and thousands more trapped under rubble. In a post on Facebook, both teams confirmed their arrival. “Our team from South Africa have arrived in #Turkey and are on their way to the disaster zone to assist in the ongoing rescue operations,” said Gift of the Givers.   The organisation said teams took off from OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport on a mission to bring hope and aid to the people of Türkiye and Syria. Medi Response said its search and rescue members, under the banner of the Gift of the Givers and alongside various other search and rescue members, had arrived safely in Türkiye. “The South African contingent have met with various international search and rescue teams as they await internal flights to affected areas. It is currently snowing with sub-zero temperatures. Good luck to all members from all units and countries,” said Medi Response.    Gift of the Givers said the devastating earthquake has claimed the lives of more than 11 000 people, leaving countless more injured and desperate for help. “Amid the shattered remains of buildings and homes, rescuers are tirelessly combing through the rubble to find and save anyone who may still be trapped,” it said. The organisation added that Turkish Airlines generously supported them by sponsoring air tickets and cargo costs for the relief mission in response to the earthquake disaster. “We express our deep appreciation for this generous support and for the facilitation of our journey to Türkiye. The Turkish flag was presented to our team as a symbol of gratitude,” said Gift of the Givers.      THE MERCURY
