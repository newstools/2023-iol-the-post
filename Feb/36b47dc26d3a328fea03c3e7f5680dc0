Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said on Thursday the reduced flow had resulted in low reservoir levels. “The City has therefore closed outlets of the affected reservoir to build up storage capacity,” he said. He said the team would open the outlets during peak periods, but intermittent water supply would be experienced. “The municipality apologises for the inconvenience caused,” said Mayisela. The following areas will be affected by water restrictions: For more information regarding water supply, the public can call the toll-free number 080 311 1111 or use the eThekwini Water and Sanitation WhatsApp number 073 1483 477.
