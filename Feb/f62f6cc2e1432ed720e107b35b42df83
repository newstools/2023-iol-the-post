Durban — The eThekwini Municipality has indicated it was working to resolve power outages affecting water systems. The municipality said city technicians were working to resolve ongoing power failures that were affecting the water supply in various parts of the City. “The ongoing interruption of water supply in various eThekwini areas is due to power outages compounded by load shedding, which subsequently affects the operation of water systems,” the municipality said. “This has led to water outages in several areas across the City.” It said that affected areas include: “In the meantime, the City will continue to deploy tankers to affected areas,” the municipality said. It apologised to its consumers for the inconvenience. “We urge communities to be patient as we work through this difficult period that the country is facing due to constraints on the national power grid,” the municipality said.
