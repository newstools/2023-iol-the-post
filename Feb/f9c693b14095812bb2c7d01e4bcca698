Durban - Trade union Uasa said motorists and commuters will have to pay more for fuel and transport costs as petrol prices went up again at midnight. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) announced yesterday that the price for 93 and 95 unleaded petrol would increase by 28 centres a litre. Diesel 0.05% Sulphur has gone up by nine cents while diesel 0.005% Sulphur decreased by a marginal 0.84 cents. Uasa spokesperson Abigail Moyo said this comes as workers are awaiting news regarding the national fuel levy that may be announced in Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's National Budget Speech in mid-February. Moyo said fuel levy increases are expected to come into effect in April in tandem with the proposed electricity tariff hike, delivering a blow to workers who will have to fork out more for both items and still find practical ways to make ends meet. “The cost of living is soaring out of control for the man in the street. While we wait for Eskom to get its act together to deliver electricity at a reasonable price consistently, Uasa encourages its members and fellow South Africans to live within their means and hold on to the little they have in the meantime,” she said.
