Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government has welcomed the decision by the South African National Road Agency (Sanral) to postpone the resumption of the payment of toll fees at the N2 oThongathi Mainline and Umvoti toll plazas. In a statement released by the KZN Department of Transport, the provincial government said the decision to halt the resumption of toll fees on the routes by Sanral came after a high-level meeting between a government delegation and the Sanral board on Tuesday evening in Durban. The statement said the government delegation was led by the MECs for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Siboniso Duma, Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Sipho Hlomuka and mayors and councillors from iLembe, KwaDukuza, Mandeni, and eThekwini. Representing Sanral were the chairperson of the board Themba Mhambi and the CEO Reginald Demana. Last month, Sanral had announced that the payments will come into effect from February 1 after the toll fees had initially been halted in April last year at these plazas due to the infrastructure damage as a result of the floods in the province. However, it said this resumption of toll fee collections would be postponed until further notice. Mhambi said in the statement released by the provincial government, that while they understood the plight of residents, there needed to be solution to the matter. “We understand the plight of the people, but we need to find a solution. Sanral and the government are losing a lot of money that should be going to maintenance. We believe that by working together with the provincial government we will find solutions,” Mhambi said. Duma said the provincial government agreed that at some stage motorists needed to resume paying tolls on the routes, but there also needed to be alternative routes available. He added they believe that with consultations they will arrive at a constructive and balanced outcome. THE MERCURY
