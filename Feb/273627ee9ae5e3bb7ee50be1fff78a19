Durban - A mother made the gruesome discovery of her murdered son lying on a footpath in Cottonlands in Verulam, north of Durban on Thursday morning. The woman, 69, had gone to search for her son, 38, when he failed to return home on Wednesday night.  Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said its paramedics responded to the incident. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said the security company received a call for assistance at approximately 6.26am. “On arrival, Rusa members were led to a pathway. The 38-year-old had sustained multiple stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. He was declared deceased by paramedics,” he said. He said according to the deceased’s mother, she had called him late last night and requested that he return home.  “This morning, she discovered that he did not return and went in search of him when she made the discovery,” Balram said. Balram said the man’s 28-year-old friend, who lives close to the pathway told reaction officers he had been drinking with the deceased at his home when two other men approached them. “He informed reaction officers that he and the deceased were consuming traditional beer at his residence last night. Two unknown males approached and befriended them. The four consumed alcohol together,” he said.   Balram said it was reported the men later decided to purchase more alcohol from a local tavern. He added the friend reported to the reaction officers he went with the two men to buy beer but they attacked him and stabbed him and then returned to the home where they stabbed the deceased.  He said the man had stab wounds to his neck and abdomen. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Verulam police are investigating a murder case. THE MERCURY
