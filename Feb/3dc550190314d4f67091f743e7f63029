Durban - A pedestrian died after being knocked and then run over by other vehicles on the R61 near Margate in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, KwaZulu Private Ambulance service spokesperson Chantell Botha said paramedics responded to the scene after receiving reports of an accident. “When emergency services arrived, they found that a pedestrian had been knocked over by a vehicle and then reportedly run over by an unknown number of vehicles,” said Botha. Paramedics assessed the scene and found that the patient had sustained critical injuries. She said the patient was treated on the scene, using advanced life-support interventions, but his condition deteriorated. “Sadly, the patient succumbed to their injuries despite the efforts of emergency services,” said Botha. Last month, Emer-G-Med reported that two pedestrians had been struck by light motor vehicles in two incidents on the M19 eastbound. Emer-G-Med spokesperson Kyle Van Reenen said that in the first incident, a woman, aged about 60, was knocked down in an alleged hit and run. “She suffered fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics,” he said. Describing the second incident, Van Reenen said that just metres up the road, under the N2 interchange, a man, believed to be in his late twenties, was struck by a Volkswagen Polo. “He too sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on arrival of paramedics,” said Van Reenen.
