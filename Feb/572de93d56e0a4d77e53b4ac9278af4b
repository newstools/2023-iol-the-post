Durban - Non-profit organisation Kendra has completed the extension to the Kendra Gardens Retirement Home which is located next to the Durban Botanical Gardens in Greyville. President Mahesh Gandecha said Kendra is a non-profit organisation and all the fully-serviced air-conditioned rooms at the retirement home are let at subsidised rates. Gandecha said where there is a shortfall in funds, the proceeds from the Kendra hall make up the deficit. He said the new facility, completed last month, will accommodate 33 more residents, taking the capacity to 160. “There are currently 50 rooms available in total,” he said. Gandecha said the home caters for senior citizens from the age of 60 and applications for the available rooms are open. “We are excited for another milestone for the community and grateful that we can assist our senior citizens in these brand new modern rooms,” he said. A Vastu (prayer) ceremony was held at the weekend in honour of the completion of the extension. At the prayer were members and officials of the Gujarati Hindu Sanskruti Kendra (GHSK), including Ramnik Juta, Gandecha and his wife Ekta, Madhavi Pragjee as well as past president Sudhir Pragjee.   Gandecha said the home has three types of rooms – single, double and a double which is more like a studio apartment.    THE MERCURY
