Durban – A 28-year-old man was arrested after police searched his home in Westville, Durban on Wednesday and discovered rifles, stolen vehicles and a police cap. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said the Provincial Tactical Response Team (TRT) conducted the search. Four stolen vehicles were found – a white Hyundai i20 which was reported stolen in central Durban in September 2022, a grey Ford Ranger which was reported stolen in Brighton Beach in September 2021, a white Toyota Fortuner and a gold Toyota Fortuner which were reported stolen in Westville and Alexander Road in April and May 2022, respectively. Netshiunda said the suspect was also found in possession of a Jet Ski which had its manufacturer’s plates filed off. “During the search police also found three rifles, two handguns and ammunition of various calibre firearms,” he said. He said the firearms would be taken for ballistics testing to determine if they had been used in the commission of a crime. “A police cap was also found in the suspect’s possession,” said Netshiunda. Police said the suspect would appear in court soon. On Monday, the SAPS reported that police operations in KwaZulu-Natal had resulted in the arrests of 2 573 suspects in two weeks, from January 26 to February 6, 2023, for various crimes in the province. “Eighty-one firearms, including four rifles and an assortment of ammunition, were also removed from society, with 24 suspects put behind bars for being in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition,” said Netshiunda.
