Durban - The Blue Security Community Crime Prevention Unit (CCPU) conducted a successful operation after a vehicle triggered licence plate recognition technology in the Westville area, which led to the arrest of a suspect linked to hijackings and theft from courier vehicles on Monday. The security company said its crime prevention team set up an observation operation in Westville North after the vehicle had been positively identified when SNIPR technology triggered an alert of the vehicle passing through the Westville area. “The team spotted and promptly intercepted the vehicle, which was driven by a male suspect who was apprehended. Capital Air and Pinetown SAPS Task Team assisted in processing the recovered vehicle and driver. An active investigation is ongoing,” it said. Blue Security said the suspect is linked to “various hijacking and theft cases of courier vehicles on the North Coast and Pinetown areas”. In an unrelated incident on Monday in the New Germany area, Blue Security said one of the company’s armed response officers apprehended a house-breaking suspect. The security company said the officer was responding to an alarm activation. While conducting his on-site inspection, he heard noises coming from the back of the property and saw the suspect jump over to the neighbouring property. “A chase ensued, and our officer apprehended the suspect. The officer handed him over to Pinetown SAPS for further investigation of the house-breaking implements and stolen items in his possession,” it said. THE MERCURY
