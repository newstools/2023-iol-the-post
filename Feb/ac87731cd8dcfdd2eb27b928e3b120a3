Durban — Snake catcher Nick Evans has warned that Mozambique spitting cobras are very active at the moment in Durban and as often is the case, the snakes clash with dogs as dogs attack them and the snakes defend themselves in an efficient fashion. Evans said that if your dog is spat on, its eyes will become red and swollen. The dogs will often rub the eye too. “It's a painful experience, but fortunately not life-threatening,” Evans said. He advised pet owners to wash their pet’s eyes out immediately with a gentle stream of water (a hosepipe on low pressure works well, or a bottle of water). This does usually require two people, more if you have a large dog. If you are really struggling, as your dog will resist, take it to a vet for help. Although taking it to a vet regardless, is the safest option. Just use water. Evans said that the cobra he rescued on Monday afternoon was in a woodpile in Westville. “An inquisitive Jack Russell got too close and ended up with a very swollen, sore eye, which I helped the owner treat,” Evans said. He reminded people that he was trying to maintain a database of such incidents, including bites, in the Greater Durban Area. So, if you hear of any, please let him know. He said he does not require any personal details.  The details he wants are the date, approximate time, dog type, area, snake species and the result. “Any help would be appreciated, although, at the same time, I'd prefer to have none to hear about!” Evans said. Meanwhile, last Wednesday, Evans ended the day with a call for a large Mozambique spitting cobra in a garage near Pinetown, west of Durban. “Longest I’ve seen in a while, at least 1.5m, maybe 1.6m. Pic doesn't do it justice. And I didn’t get spat at, which was a real bonus,” Evans said. WhatsApp your views on this story at 071 485 7995 Daily News
