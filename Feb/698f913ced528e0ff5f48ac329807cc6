Durban - iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority says it is a common occurrence to see hippos walking at night at St Lucia in northern KwaZulu-Natal.  This follows a video on social media that shows two hippos walking at night near a hotel in St Lucia. The video garnered several comments including from people who said they had seen hippos on the street before.  “The hippos have roamed the streets of St Lucia for as long as I can remember and nobody tries to chase or rescue them, let nature be, we intruded on their habitat,” one man commented. One woman said it was incredible to see the hippos.  “We spent some time at the hotel shortly before Covid-19 and from the upstairs lounge we witnessed the hippos in the road below. Beautiful sight.”   ISimangaliso spokesperson Bheki Manzini said it was common to see hippos walking in St Lucia at night.  “Hippos spend time in the river during the day and come out at night to graze and we see them all the time. There’s no need to be concerned as the hippos that come into town are used to people. Remember this is one of the tourist attractions at St Lucia.” Manzini advised members of the public to not get too close to the hippos.  “Just be vigilant, it is important not to get close to them. They feel threatened if we get close. Remember that some of the hippos are walking with their calves and they will protect their calf as any animal will do.” THE MERCURY
