DURBAN - Transitioning from high school to a tertiary institution may be daunting at first for the matric classes of 2022. But two of the recent high achievers look forward to this new phase in their lives. Theesan Narasimulu, 17, from Malvern, was placed 10th in KwaZulu-Natal and 4th in the uMlazi district. He attended Kharwastan Secondary and attained 8 distinctions with a 95.4% aggregate. Theesan will study medicine at UKZN's Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine. “I chose medicine because helping other people is unmatched, and the satisfaction is priceless. Now that university life is just over a week away, I am a little anxious. “I know learning in a new environment will be a challenge and the level of work will be different from high school. I don't really know what to expect but meeting new people will be fun and I know I will enjoy campus life. “I have a good support structure and I will have friends at UKZN. This will definitely help to cope with challenges because we can support each other.” Lectures start on February 13.   – Rhea Boodrn, 17, matriculated from Kharwastan Secondary and will study computer science at UKZN.  She said: “Attending university is an exciting new chapter in my life. Now I get to focus on something that is a passion while meeting new people. I’m nervous but definitely excited. “I expect university will be different from school, so my challenge would be adapting to the new rules and ways of the university. I’m not sure how I will deal with these challenges, so I will have to take the first few weeks to get used to university life." She said she chose computer science because information technology was her favourite subject at school.  "I love programming and problem-solving, so computer science fits me well." Rhea's lectures start on February 11. Her advice to the matric class of 2023: “Work hard for the year and relax after your exams. All your efforts will pay off."   THE POST
