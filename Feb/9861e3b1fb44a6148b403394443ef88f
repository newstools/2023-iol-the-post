Durban -  Marshall Security said it recovered three suspected stolen vehicles in the Durban area. Marshall Security’s managing director Tyron Powell said two of the suspected stolen vehicles were found in Phoenix and the other in Inanda. Powell said members of Marshall’s special ops team were activated to assist Matrix Tracking with locating a Toyota Etios that had been reported as stolen from the Point area in Durban. “Our members immediately responded to the last known location and within a couple of minutes the vehicle was found abandoned on a property on Rainside Crescent in the Phoenix area, where it was recovered by members of our Special Ops Team, Matrix ground team, and the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit,” he said. He said witnesses reported that the suspects had allegedly left the scene only minutes prior to the teams arriving. He added that another suspected stolen Toyota Etios, which was reported stolen in the Hillary area in Pinetown last week Saturday, was also found. Powell said both vehicles were transported back to the Phoenix police station for further investigation and processing. Meanwhile, later that day at approximately 8pm, Powell said their members were activated to assist Cartrack with finding a white Isuzu that had been reported stolen in the Phoenix area that evening. “Our members immediately responded to the last known location in Inanda and within 30 minutes of being dispatched, the vehicle was found abandoned and recovered on a dirt road by our Special Ops Team and Cartrack ground team,” he said. Powell added that the client declined to open a case and the vehicle was returned. THE MERCURY
