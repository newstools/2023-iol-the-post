Durban - Details related to the whereabouts of a tiger spotted roaming around a parking lot at an office in Edenvale, Gauteng, last week, remains unclear. Previous reports stated that the tiger was spotted in Cabot Road in Eastleigh Ridge. In a 49-second video the tiger was seen circling a car. Douglas Wolhuter, Wildlife Protection Unit - Manager at National Council of SPCAs, said they have been granted warrants to search properties for the tiger and are in the process of seeking legal advice. "There are rumours that abound but nothing that can be substantiated. Warrants were effected,  but no tiger was found at the various properties. The society is in the process of securing legal advice which we will only know the outcome on Monday as the meeting is only happening on Sunday with their legal counsel," said Wolhuter. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
