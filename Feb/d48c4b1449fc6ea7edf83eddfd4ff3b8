Durban - The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) says there has been an overall shift in KwaZulu-Natal’s murder patterns. According to the ISS, the annualised projections based on SAPS statistics for April to September 2022 indicate that the 2022/23 annual murder rate may be over 44 murders per 100 000 people, which means South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. This applies to countries that are not at war and for which reliable data is available. The institute said there has been a dramatic increase in murders in KwaZulu-Natal. “Murder there [in KZN] decreased slightly in 2020/21 to 4 825 cases but surged by 35% in 2021/22 to 6 495, raising the provincial rate to 56 deaths per 100 000,” said ISS. It said only about 180 of these new incidents were directly linked to the widespread July 2021 riots and unrest, indicating that other factors are driving the increase. “KwaZulu-Natal’s murder rate is projected to continue upward, reaching 60 per 100 000, confirming an overall shift in the province’s murder patterns,” said the ISS. The institute noted that in the province more than 10% of victims die in incidents where multiple fatalities are recorded. It added that the per capita rise in murders in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have been the greatest in the past few years. The ISS said good policing can bring down murder and other notable crimes such as robbery. “But declines in the SAPS budget mean that existing police resources must be used better,” it said.
