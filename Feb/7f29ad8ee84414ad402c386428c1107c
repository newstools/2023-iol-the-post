Durban – A gang of thieves were caught ransacking a furniture store on Hill Street in Pinetown in the early hours of Sunday morning. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said eight suspects, seven of whom were foreign nationals, were arrested just before 2am on Sunday morning following a break-in at a furniture store. Netshiunda said a private security company responded to an active alarm call and reportedly found the suspects in the process of ransacking the store. “One suspect allegedly attempted to stab a security guard with a knife and the guard shot him in the leg,” he said. Describing the sequence of events that led to the arrest of the eight suspects, Blue Security said when the armed response officer arrived at the scene, they went to the rear of the building. They noticed the door was broken and items were spread outside. The security company said the officers then cautiously approached the entrance of the store where they found suspects. “A knife-wielding suspect tried to attack one of our officers and a shooting ensued where a suspect was shot,” said Blue Security. According to Blue Security, the other suspects tried to escape into another business but were intercepted by their back-up armed response team and police. “Pinetown SAPS arrived and arrested three more suspects including the driver of the getaway vehicle,” said the company.
