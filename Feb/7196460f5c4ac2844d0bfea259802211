Durban - Marshall Security armed response officers foiled a business robbery on Umgeni Road in the early hours of Tuesday. The security company’s managing director Tyron Powell said at approximately 1.40pm the Marshall Security Emergency Dispatch Centre received reports of a break-in in progress at a business premises. Powell said multiple armed response officers were immediately dispatched and arrived on scene within 3 minutes. “As our officers arrived, it was found that a padlock on one of the main gates had been cut and a jack had been used to force open roller shutter doors to gain entry into the business premises,” he said. He said the team spotted three suspects on the property. “One suspect was found hiding behind a container on the property and was immediately apprehended by our officers. Unfortunately, the other two suspects managed to evade arrest,” said Powell. According to Powell, the client was contacted and wanted to proceed with opening a case against the suspect. He said at this stage nothing appeared to have been stolen during the break-in, but a full inventory would be conducted by the client. “The Durban Central SAPS were contacted and arrived on scene a short while later and transported the suspect to the Durban Central SAPS station where the suspect will be charged for business break-in,” said Powell.
